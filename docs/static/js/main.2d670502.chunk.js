It\'s exposed only via `ReactSharedInternals` and there is no plan to make it an officially supported public API.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis API is intended to allow privileged consumers (React Native etc) to process the information in component stacks without [rolling their own parsers](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/f3d37325cbeb25db2aae2f5aa7b37de7b8a06f82/Libraries/LogBox/Data/parseLogBoxLog.js#L126-L146) (and without requiring direct access to React\'s internal data structures). Additionally, this will allow React to change the format of component stacks as needed without breaking these consumers.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis specific design is informed by a previous discussion between @sebmarkbage, @gaearon, @rickhanlonii and myself. The implementation is the best I could come up with naively but I\'m sure there are wrinkles to be ironed out.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Context for this change\\r\\n\\r\\nWe want to make it possible to decode component stacks using a source map, as a sustainable alternative to adding `displayName` properties to components in minified builds. Thanks to [function maps in Metro](https://github.com/facebook/metro/commit/64fc81e676ea781234dfe20c2bfaabdb1bef6b9e) and the Hermes [`getFunctionLocation`](https://github.com/facebook/hermes/commit/7364f96f19f87ea9317ca65541a8f154e2e839ff) API, this will first be possible for React Native apps using Hermes, but can translate to other environments given the required support from build tooling and VMs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe plan is for React to feature-detect `getFunctionLocation`, call it on each component and encode the result in the component stack string, as well as expose it in the output of this parser.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Test Plan\\r\\n\\r\\nTests, Flow","created_at":"2020-02-15T22:35:05Z"},{"number":18042,"id":565589905,"title":"Docs: https://es.reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html Spanish translation error","user":{"login":"Zeitgeist-J","id":51766256},"state":"closed","body":"\ud83d\udea8 This issue tracker is not for documentation issues. \ud83d\udea8\\r\\n\\r\\nWithin the \'The Data Flows Down\' section there is an error on the spanish version, where it would be correct to say :\\r\\n- \'... pueden saber si un determinado componente tiene o no estado y no les deber\xeda importar...\' \\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of:\\r\\n-  \' ...pueden saber si un determinado componente tiene o no **tiene** estado y no les deber\xeda importar...\'","created_at":"2020-02-14T22:35:36Z"},{"number":18041,"id":565529443,"title":"React developer tools extension for Microsoft Edge ","user":{"login":"hmohamme","id":61028636},"state":"closed","body":"\x3c!--\\r\\n  Thanks for submitting a pull request!\\r\\n  We appreciate you spending the time to work on these changes.

However, we will still wait until the next message event before flushing it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis commit changes `unstable_advanceTime` to more closely resemble the browser behavior, by removing the automatic flushing of expired work.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// Before this commit\\r\\nScheduler.unstable_advanceTime(ms);\\r\\n\\r\\n// Equivalent behavior after this commit\\r\\nScheduler.unstable_advanceTime(ms);\\r\\nScheduler.unstable_flushExpired();\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe general principle is to prefer separate APIs for scheduling tasks and flushing them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis change does not affect any public APIs. `unstable_advanceTime` is only used by our own test suite. It is not used by `act`.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, we may need to update tests in www, like Relay\'s.","created_at":"2020-02-03T22:20:14Z"},{"number":17966,"id":559282153,"title":"Bug: When throwing an error on component render, the component rerenders and throws twice, but componentDidCatch runs only once.","user":{"login":"EduVencovsky","id":37600269},"state":"open","body":"This [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60044579/why-is-this-component-being-rendered-after-throwing-an-error/60044809#60044809) on stack overflow was made and while trying to solve it, I realized something.\\r\\n\\r\\nI found out that on version `16.12.0` of react, when you throw an error on the render method, it render and throws the error twice, but `componentDidCatch` runs only once.\\r\\n\\r\\nI version `16.0.0` it throws the error only once.\\r\\n\\r\\nReact version:\\r\\n\\r\\n`16.0.0` throws the error only once.\\r\\n`16.12.0` throws the error twice .\\r\\n\\r\\n## Steps To Reproduce\\r\\n\\r\\n1.

I duplicated the event replaying tests to now include Flare too, just like the partial hydration tests already did. The existing tests only covered passive events.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe primary problem is that if there is no active listener attached, then the `IS_ACTIVE` flag isn\'t passed into `DEPRECATED_dispatchEventForResponderEventSystem`. So the replaying of the events, like Press, that normally listen to active events doesn\'t work.\\r\\n\\r\\nReplaying doesn\'t technically need to be active for all events. It\'s not guaranteed to always work to preventDefault if the code hasn\'t loaded yet. We could make the listeners attached as passive in the DOM but still pass the `IS_ACTIVE` flag. That would still \\"work\\" but it wouldn\'t actually work to prevent default.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem is that we do use a best-effort attempt to allow `preventDefault` to work. Most of the time it just works because we are able to synchronously hydrate within the event. That\'s also how we preventDefault on links to prevent the browser from taking over.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I think ideally, at least _some_ event should still be attached as active such as `submit`, `click` and the `key` events. We don\'t have to make them all active.

Create a component\\r\\n2. Add state indicating whether it is enabled or disabled (advised to start as enabled)\\r\\n3. On render, let the component return a `<fieldset>` with: a `<legend>` containing an `<input>` (checkbox) element, and another form element (`<select>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`).\\r\\n4. Add the `disabled` attribute that follows the aforementioned state to the `<fieldset>`.\\r\\n5. Make the `onChange` event of the `<input>` in the `<fieldset>` responsible for modifying the state of the component (enabled/disabled). \\r\\n6. Run an app that uses the described component.\\r\\n7. Disable the `<fieldset>` using the `<input>` in its `<legend>`.\\r\\n8. (Try to) enable the `<fieldset>`.\\r\\n\\r\\nLink to code example: [Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/wizardly-ellis-45sel?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark)\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport React from \\"react\\";\\r\\n\\r\\nexport default function App() {\\r\\n  const [enabled, setEnabled] = React.useState(true);\\r\\n  return <React.Fragment>\\r\\n    <fieldset disabled={!enabled}>\\r\\n      <legend>\\r\\n        <input \\r\\n          type=\\"checkbox\\"\\r\\n          checked={enabled}\\r\\n          onChange={(evt)=>{setEnabled(evt.target.checked);}}/>\\r\\n      </legend>\\r\\n      <textarea></textarea>\\r\\n    </fieldset>\\r\\n    <p>\\r\\n      Disable the above fieldset by unchecking the checkbox. Checking the box once again does not re-enable the fieldset however.\\r\\n    </p>\\r\\n  </React.Fragment>;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## The current behavior\\r\\nEnabling the `<fieldset>` using the `<input>` in its `<legend>` changes the state of the `<input>` in unchecked fashion; it does not fire its `onChange` event and its value does thus no longer match the state of the component.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The expected behavior\\r\\nBased on the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/html/wiki/Elements/fieldset) and [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-fieldset-element) spec, the contents of the first `<legend>` of a `<fieldset>` should not be disabled when that fieldset is disabled. \\r\\n\\r\\nOne would expect that if an element does not appear disabled, its events will be triggered.

The last tab navigation supersedes all the previous ones.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, this only applies to transitions that update the same part of the UI. For example, if you click a new tab, and in the meantime you click a drop-down menu, it doesn\'t matter whether the tab or the menu appears first. They are independent, parallel transitions.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo implement this behavior, we will treat transitions as **overlapping** if they share at least one state queue between them. The result of the most recent transition in an overlapping sequence is considered the **terminal** state. The rest are considered **intermediate** states. We will avoid showing intermediate states by batching them together with the terminal one.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen there are overlapping transitions, the `isPending` states of the `useTransition` hooks that correspond to the intermediate states are turned off (unless they happen to be the same `useTransition` hook as the terminal one).\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nI iterated on the implementation several times. I\'ve squashed most of the commits to reduce noise when reviewing. You can see some of the unsquashed steps in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17418. If this is too much to review in a single PR, I can split the commits back up again; however, I don\'t think it\'s worth landing in more than two steps because there are only two useful features here.

This PR is one small step of many in order to do that. This PR makes the following changes:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Adds a `DO_NOT_USE` prefix to most Scope API methods that are potentially dangerous and will likely change or go away.\\r\\n- Provides a new experiemental method call `getChildContextValues` that attempts to work with existing React Context.

First, establish that `App` has two `useFancyState` calls.\\r\\n   - Our transform does this with a call like `_s(App, \'useFancyState(x) useFancyState(y)\', () => [useFancyState, useFancyState])`\\r\\n2. Then, when we\'re inside `App` for the first time, trigger the function to save their identities\\r\\n   - Our transform does this with a call like `_s()`\\r\\n\\r\\nWe intentionally trigger the function to save function identities lazily on first render. This is so that we don\'t change the module definition order when you have inline requires.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe reuse the same function to minimize the transform noise. So we count calls. First call saves `() => [useFancyState, useFancyState]`, second call actually triggers it to get references. Next calls don\'t do anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis usually works, but it breaks in the corner case like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nrender(<App />);\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction App() { ... }\\r\\nfunction useFancyState() { ... }\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is because we end up *inside* `App` before the *first* call injected by our transform runs. So we get the \\"inside\\" call before we get the \\"outside\\" call.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is edge casey but can happen in environments like CodeSandbox where you write all code in one file.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fix is to not rely on the call index, and instead to look at what we\'re passing. With this fix, we ignore all empty `_s()` calls until after we actually get the first `_s(App, ...)` registration call.

To prevent state update batching, the process is started using `setTimeout`. A line of console output is written in the render function, and this output shows 1000 times on the console. At the same time, the state does not change and the component rendering does not reflect any updated state until such time the busy-loop process ends.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The expected behavior\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'m investigating options to trigger UI updates from long-running processes like that modelled in this example. I would prefer option 1 for expected behavior: when `setState` is called, it should update the state and then trigger a render.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince I don\'t know whether my approach is the \\"correct\\" or intended one for my purpose, I would also accept option 2: no state change, no render. In this case I\'m back to researching other alternatives.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn any case it seems wrong to me that renders are triggered by the `setState` calls, even though no state change takes place. This is why I\'m reporting the issue as a bug.","created_at":"2020-01-10T20:56:03Z"},{"number":17819,"id":548028528,"title":"Error: \\"f.hasOwnProperty is not a function\\"","user":{"login":"MichaelOstrovsky","id":18550093},"state":"closed","body":"Describe what you were doing when the bug occurred:\\r\\n1.

Here is an example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nconst data = useContext(MyContext, value => value.data); // value = context value\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen the second function argument is defined, only the returned value from the function will be compared and accessed. This will simplify a lot of workflows where multiple contexts are used for multiple values in order to reduce the number of context updates. Here is an example from [Hooks FAQ](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-avoid-passing-callbacks-down) (modified a little bit):\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nfunction TodosApp() {\\r\\n  // Note: `dispatch` won\'t change between re-renders\\r\\n  const [todos, dispatch] = useReducer(todosReducer);\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <TodosData.Provider value={todos}>\\r\\n      <TodosDispatch.Provider value={dispatch}>\\r\\n        <DeepTree todos={todos} />\\r\\n      </TodosDispatch.Provider>\\r\\n    </TodosData.Provider>\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction DeepChild(props) {\\r\\n  // If we want to perform an action, we can get dispatch from context.\\r\\n  const dispatch = useContext(TodosDispatch);\\r\\n\\r\\n  function handleClick() {\\r\\n    dispatch({ type: \'add\', text: \'hello\' });\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>Add todo</button>\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction AnotherDeepChild(props) {\\r\\n  const data = useContext(TodosData);\\r\\n  ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the proposed API addition, we can just use the same context to do retrieve two different values:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nfunction TodosApp() {\\r\\n  // Note: `dispatch` won\'t change between re-renders\\r\\n  const [todos, dispatch] = useReducer(todosReducer);\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <TodosContext.Provider value={{ todos, dispatch }}>\\r\\n        <DeepTree todos={todos} />\\r\\n    </TodosContext.Provider>\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction DeepChild(props) {\\r\\n  const dispatch = useContext(TodosContext, value => value.dispatch);\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction AnotherDeepChild(props) {\\r\\n  const todos = useContext(TodosContext, value => value.todos);\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother useful scenario for this addition is dynamically selecting items from a centralized store based on context. If a developer needs to selectively retrieve specific values from an object, they can do it very easily. Something similar to Redux\' `useSelector` but is part of a normal Context Flow:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nfunction UserInfoApp() {\\r\\n  // Note: `dispatch` won\'t change between re-renders\\r\\n  const [user, dispatch] = useReducer(userReducer, { name: ..., dob: ..., active: ... });\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <UserInfoContext.Provider value={user}>\\r\\n        <DeepTree todos={todos} />\\r\\n    </UserInfoContext.Provider>\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction UserInfoTable(props) {\\r\\n  const name = useContext(UserInfoContext, value => value.name);\\r\\n  const dob = useContext(UserInfoContext, value => value.dob);\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction UserActiveTracker(props) {\\r\\n  const todos = useContext(UserInfoContext, value => value.active);\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, if `active` value is changed, only `UserActiveTracker` will be updated. If `name` or `dob` is changed, only `UserInfoTable` will be activated. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe API can also be implemented for `Context.Consumer` component:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\n<MyContext.Consumer selector={value => value.active}> ... </MyContext.Consumer>\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nand `static contextType` static class variable:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\\r\\n  static contextType = MyContext;\\r\\n  static contextSelector = value => value.active;\\r\\n\\r\\n  render() {\\r\\n    const val = this.context.active;\\r\\n    const wrongVal = this.context.name; // = undefined\\r\\n\\r\\n    return ...\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n","created_at":"2020-01-04T13:51:19Z"},{"number":17776,"id":545285055,"title":"Allow direct construction of components when implementing a custom ComponentFactory ","user":{"login":"Roaders","id":10414642},"state":"closed","body":"\x3c!--\\r\\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\\r\\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\\r\\n--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\nFeature\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\nWhen implementing a `ComponentFactory` the type is returned in the `ReactElement` instead of a constructed instance of the class.\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\nAn optional function to create the instance could be included on the `ReactElement` interface:\\r\\n```\\r\\n    interface ReactElement<P = any, T extends string | JSXElementConstructor<any> = string | JSXElementConstructor<any>> {\\r\\n        type: T;\\r\\n        props: P;\\r\\n        key: Key | null;\\r\\n        construct: () => InstanceType<T> // example return type\\r\\n    }\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis would allow the developer to provide default logic when constructing the instance.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy use case for this is to enable Dependency Injection of constructor params.\\r\\n","created_at":"2020-01-04T13:27:24Z"},{"number":17775,"id":545267184,"title":"Scope dev tools wildcard styles within DevTools CSS class","user":{"login":"GasimGasimzada","id":807231},"state":"closed","body":"Previously, wildcard selector was used to apply global styles that are related to DevTools.

This removes the coupling between DevTools and a React internal implementation detail that may change.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe DevTools has two choices of criteria for this filtering:\\r\\n* Filter commits that have no actual duration metadata.\\r\\n* Filter commits that have no recorded operations (no mutations to the tree, no changed tree base durations).\\r\\n\\r\\nI chose the first option, filtering by commits that have no reported\xa0metadata.

That means, moving into a portal will be the last time we get a `pointerleave` event fire because we only track `pointerleave` for target events.

Profiling metadata (e.g. durations, which values changed, etc.) for each commit.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt uses this information (snapshot + operations diff) to reconstruct the state of the application for a given commit as it\'s viewed in the Profiler UI. Because of this, it\'s very important that the operations and metadata arrays align. If they don\'t align, the profiler will be unable to correctly reconstruct the tree for a given commit, and it will likely throw errors (like \\"Could not find node\u2026\\")\\r\\n\\r\\n#16446 tracks a long-standing bug where the profiler is unable to correctly regenerate the tree for a commit. I believe it is because the two arrays I mentioned above are misaligned. I am still not entirely sure what causes the original bug, but I made it worse with PR #17253 by introducing another potential way for it to happen. This PR addresses that regression at least (and adds test coverage for it).\\r\\n\\r\\nI will follow up this afternoon on the original #16446 issue. I think I may have [a lead](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16446#issuecomment-570289883) on what\'s happening at least, if not exactly an idea of how to reproduce it. I believe this fix is worth landing on its own though, since it seems to have made the bug easier to trigger.","created_at":"2020-01-02T19:46:51Z"},{"number":17758,"id":544666379,"title":"Fixed CircleCI DevTools build artifact tar internal structure","user":{"login":"bvaughn","id":29597},"state":"closed","body":"Oops.

It\'s interesting feature which allows use state and other React features without writing a class, but unfortunately it\'s very difficult to understand. When I see a class component I understand that React creates instance of this class which holds some state and React calls lifecycle methods in different situations during mounting, props changing and unmounting. It makes me write a bit more code but all this code is verbose and easy to understand if you know some basic (not React-specific) JavaScript conceptions. It is said in [Hooks documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html):\\r\\n\\r\\n> In addition to making code reuse and code organization more difficult, we\u2019ve found that classes can be a large barrier to learning React. You have to understand how this works in JavaScript, which is very different from how it works in most languages. You have to remember to bind the event handlers.\\r\\n\\r\\nYes, all of these facts are possible. You have to understand how JavaScript works if you want to use it to build programs. Yes, JavaScript Object Model differs from the other languages like C++ or Java. But I think it\'s fair enough: if you want to use JavaScript you need to understand how it works. E.g. if you want to write iOS native programs with Objective C you have to understand now reference counting works and it\'s OK. A lot of well known projects like [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) or [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) uses `this` concept.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course you can use another approach and write code in functional way when you have strict separation between data and functions processing this data. In this case function receives data as a parameters, process it and return new date. It\'s also OK.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when you try to mix stateful components and pure functions without closures to store some state it makes code very tricky.\\r\\n\\r\\nLast few months a lot of people have told me that Hooks are awesome and it\'s easier to understand than class components and shows me examples like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport React, { useState } from \'react\';\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction Example() {\\r\\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we\'ll call \\"count\\"\\r\\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <div>\\r\\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\\r\\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\\r\\n        Click me\\r\\n      </button>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when I asked about how this example works almost none of them answered. Why first `Example` is called `useState` returns 0 and second one - 1? This function is called with no parameters 2 times and returns different results. I see no closure. How does it work? How can I test it without some special React magic? How can I emulate the second call without the first one? Where is the state actually stored? You have to understand React sources deeply to answer all these questions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only possibility to implement `useState` is a global variable inside React and there are a lot of articles on the Internet that global variables are very fragile approach and if you can avoid using it - it\'s better to avoid it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have a big code base and it\'s very important to understand which component has it\'s own state and which does not. Before React 16.8 it was clear: functional components do not have own state and class components have but now there is no strict border and any functional component can be stateful. This makes it more difficult to refactor code base.\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I call function with particular parameters twice I receive the same results. `useState` and other Hooks do not have such behavior. I think it\'s possible to make hooks more obvious if there will be explicit parameter `context`:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport React, { useState } from \'react\';\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction Example(context) {\\r\\n  // Declare a new state variable, which we\'ll call \\"count\\"\\r\\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(context, 0);\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <div>\\r\\n      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>\\r\\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>\\r\\n        Click me\\r\\n      </button>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nReact will provide `context` to functional components and it will be clear how `useState` works without looking throw source codes of React. Also it will be easier to refactor and test such code.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

However, I wondered if to achieve this, another higher language was really necessary. For me, the ability to use JS freely is valueable. I wonder, can we improve developer experience in such a way and remain in JS? \\r\\n\\r\\n## General Proposal\\r\\nJSX introduced an elegant syntax-compilation solution. \\r\\n```jsx\\r\\n<element prop=\\"value\\">child</element>\\r\\n```\\r\\nCompiles to: \\r\\n```js\\r\\nReact.createElement(\\"element\\", {prop:\\"value\\", children:\\"child\\"})\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis solution allows us to enjoy both worlds - stay in JS, yet use dedicated syntax which makes our code easier to read and write. My suggestion is to extend this (syntax-compilation) pattern to the basic hooks, and state management in React. User will be able to opt-in to easy to use compilation solutions, by using dedicated syntax. \\r\\n\\r\\nHooks are ideal candidates: \\r\\n1. They come with non trivial constrainsts (Returned value depends on execution order, so they must be at the top level). With the use of a dedicated syntax, they can be grasped and treated as different from a regular function call.  \\r\\n2. Optimizing is more difficult - Optimizing for performance requires knowledge and attention to implementation details. This includes: React.memo, useCallback, useMemo, and passing dependencies. It requires more code, and is somewhat more [bug prone](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53070970/infinite-loop-in-useeffect).\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother ideal candidate is state management, which comes with it\'s own necessary contraints. Most noteably is that updating state should be done immutably. While this is essential in React, it could also be a burden on the developer, and is bug prone. I think this as well could be elegently solved with compilation. \\r\\n\\r\\n## Proposal Details \\r\\nSome of the ideas I will present might be contraversial, but they do demonstrate the general proposal, and demonstrate a few possible directions. \\r\\nProposal includes the following: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. A dedicated sign for state\\r\\n2. A dedicated sign for reactive-memoized values (which change if, and only if, dependencies change.)\\r\\n3. A dedicated sign for effects. \\r\\n4. In JSX elements support shorthand attribute assignment (similar to ES6 Object shorthand property names)\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ll demonstrate what it could look like, with this simple [Complete and Tell todo app](https://complete-and-share.stackblitz.io).\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nconst TasksApp = () => {\\r\\n\\tconst [tasks, setTasks] = useState(initialTasks)\\r\\n\\tconst [competitionStatus, setcompetitionStatus] = useState([])\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tconst addTask = useCallback(\\r\\n\\t\\t(text) => setTasks( tasks => [{text, completed: false, id:+ new Date()}, ...tasks]), \\r\\n\\t\\t[]\\r\\n\\t)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tconst toggleCompleted = useCallback(\\r\\n\\t\\t(id) => setTasks( \\r\\n\\t\\t\\ttasks => tasks.map( \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttask => (task.id!=id)? task : {...task, completed: !task.completed}\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t)\\r\\n\\t\\t), \\r\\n\\t\\t[]\\r\\n\\t)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tconst completedTasks = useMemo(\\r\\n\\t\\t()=>tasks.reduce(\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t(accum, task) => accum+task.completed,\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t0\\r\\n\\t\\t), \\r\\n\\t\\t[tasks]\\r\\n\\t)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tuseEffect(\\r\\n\\t\\t() => {\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tconst updateCompetition = () => {\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconst status = fetchCompetition(completedTasks)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsetcompetitionStatus(status)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t}\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tupdateCompetition()\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tconst interval = setInterval(updateCompetition, 10000)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\treturn () => clearInterval(interval)\\r\\n\\t\\t}, \\r\\n\\t\\t[completedTasks]\\r\\n\\t)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\treturn (\\r\\n\\t\\t<>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<h1>Complete and share</h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<Competition competitionStatus={competitionStatus} />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<InviteFriend />\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<SelfStats completedTasks={completedTasks} />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<AddTask addTask={addTask}/>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<TaskList tasks={tasks} toggleCompleted={toggleCompleted} />\\r\\n\\t\\t</>\\r\\n\\t)\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\nI\'ll now write the same code, but relay on syntax-compilation to solve the challenges I metnioned above. I\'ll use `#` as a sign for state, `$` as a sign for memoization, and `%` as a sign for effects. \\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nconst TasksApp = () => {\\r\\n\\t# tasks = initialTasks\\r\\n\\t# competitionStatus = []\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t$ addTask = (text) => tasks.push({text, completed: false, id:+ new Date()})\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t$ toggleCompleted = (id) => tasks[id].completed = !tasks[id].completed\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t$ completedTasks = ()=>tasks.reduce(\\r\\n\\t\\t(accum, task) => accum+task.completed,\\r\\n\\t\\t0\\r\\n\\t)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t%\\tconst updateCompetition = () => {\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tconst status = fetchCompetition(completedTasks)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tcompetitionStatus.set(status)\\r\\n\\t\\t}\\r\\n\\t\\tupdateCompetition()\\r\\n\\t\\tconst interval = setInterval(updateCompetition, 10000)\\r\\n\\t\\t%\\tclearInterval(interval)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\treturn (\\r\\n\\t\\t<>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<h1>Complete and share</h1>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<Competition competitionStatus />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<InviteFriend />\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<SelfStats completedTasks />\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<AddTask addTask/>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<TaskList tasks toggleCompleted />\\r\\n\\t\\t</>\\r\\n\\t)\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis component is equivelent, and will compile to the same code, as the original TaskApp above it. \\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s look at \\r\\n```jsx\\r\\n$ toggleCompleted = (id) => tasks[id].completed = !tasks[id].completed\\r\\n```\\r\\nThe compiler should recognize that tasks is a state thing, and convert the mutating code to a state updating code. \\r\\n```jsx\\r\\n$ toggleCompleted = (id) => setTasks( \\r\\n\\ttasks => tasks.map( \\r\\n\\t\\ttask => (task.id!=id)? task : {...task, completed: !task.completed}\\r\\n\\t)\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\nIt should also recognize that toggleCompleted should be memoized. Looking at the code, it doesn\'t relay on values that are not passed as parameters, so there are no dependencies. It can complete the convertion of the function to the final code: \\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nconst toggleCompleted = useCallback(\\r\\n\\t(id) => setTasks( \\r\\n\\t\\ttasks => tasks.map( \\r\\n\\t\\t\\ttask => (task.id!=id)? task : {...task, completed: !task.completed}\\r\\n\\t\\t)\\r\\n\\t), \\r\\n\\t[]\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\nMemoizing this function with `useCallback` requires technical and repetitive work. It is somewhat of a burden on the developer, and a compiler might just be better at it. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs for updating state in this example, for deep nested state updates this approach will yield greater benefits. Immutability wise, it is somewhat similar to Immer. Code could be written mutably, and have an immutable effect. \\r\\n\\r\\nLets look at another component: \\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nconst AddTask = ({addTask}) => {\\r\\n\\tconst [value, setValue] = useState(\\"\\")\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tconst changeHandler = useCallback(\\r\\n\\t\\t(e) => setValue(e.target.value), \\r\\n\\t\\t[]\\r\\n\\t)\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\tconst onClick = useCallback(\\r\\n\\t\\t()=>{\\r\\n\\t\\t\\taddTask(value)\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tsetValue(\\"\\")\\r\\n\\t\\t}, \\r\\n\\t\\t[value, addTask]\\r\\n\\t)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\treturn (\\r\\n\\t\\t<div className=\\"add-task\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div>Add Task</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<input value={value} onChange={changeHandler} /> \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<button onClick={onClick}>Add</button> \\r\\n\\t\\t</div>\\r\\n\\t)\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nexport default React.memo(AddTask)\\r\\n```\\r\\nIn the suggested syntax: \\r\\n```jsx\\r\\n$ AddTask = ({addTask}) => {\\r\\n\\t# value = \\"\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t$ onClick = ()=>{\\r\\n\\t\\taddTask(value)\\r\\n\\t\\tvalue = \\"\\"\\r\\n\\t}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\treturn (\\r\\n\\t\\t<div className=\\"add-task\\">\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<div>Add Task</div>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<input #value /> \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t<button onClick>Add</button> \\r\\n\\t\\t</div>\\r\\n\\t)\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nexport default AddTask\\r\\n``` \\r\\nIn these examples all memoised values share the same syntax. Based on the memoized object, the compiler can wrap the code in `React.memo`, `useCallback` or `useMemo`. \\r\\n\\r\\nThese examples also demonstrate shorthand attribute/props assignment in JSX elements. This makes it easier to pass props, which is important because it makes reusing components easier. Further more, it makes JSX more aligned with JS, since JS now supports this feature for objects. \\r\\n\\r\\n`<input #value />` demonstrates an option to bind state value to an input\'s value.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing the suggested syntax in this app, **components were written in 29% less source code.** \\r\\n\\r\\n## Summery\\r\\nDeveloper will be able to use JS as before, but could also opt to use such compilation solutions. The above solutions provide the following benefits: \\r\\n\\r\\n1. In a sense it\'s more declerative - User can declare a value to be reactive-memoized, or state-immutable, without worrying how it is implemented. \\r\\n2. (Once a programmer is familiar with the syntax) Less overhead for reading and writting.\\r\\n3. All of the above probably means app will be less bug prone. \\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n","created_at":"2019-12-21T11:46:31Z"},{"number":17684,"id":541301609,"title":"Error: \\"Could not find node with id \\"312\\" in commit tree\\"","user":{"login":"developerium","id":7695492},"state":"closed","body":"Describe what you were doing when the bug occurred:\\r\\n1.

I haven\'t figured out the pattern yet of which components will trigger a crash. \\r\\n\\r\\nI know that this repro isn\'t particularly actionable at this point, but I\'m hoping that someone who knows the RDT code better than I do might have an idea about why this might be happening.\\r\\n","created_at":"2019-12-19T23:56:35Z"},{"number":17669,"id":540633902,"title":"Refactor Expiration Time Model","user":{"login":"acdlite","id":3624098},"state":"open","body":"## Based on #17418\\r\\n\\r\\nStack of changes to replace our \\"expiration time\\" model with something better.\\r\\n\\r\\n- [x] Decouple expiration times from transition timeouts","created_at":"2019-12-19T23:15:49Z"},{"number":17668,"id":540629695,"title":"Disable unsupported context menu options for Firefox","user":{"login":"bvaughn","id":29597},"state":"closed","body":"Unfortunately the \\"copy to clipboard\\" and \\"go to definition\\" context menu options do not work for the Firefox add-on.

It\'s meant to be verbose so larger building blocks can be created on top of them.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR is an alternative solution and system to that of my other PR: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17508. Specifically, based off feedback internally, I\'ve tried to tackle some of the problems that were brought up with the `createListener` approach in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17508:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `createListener` largely depended on events being registered in the commit phase, meaning that there would likely be issues around needing to flush more to ensure we register DOM events. The new approach enforces all events are registered unconditionally via hooks in the render phase, mitigating this issue.\\r\\n- `createListener` allowed for listeners to update and change their properties between renders, which again is problematic for performance and would also require more flushes to ensure we have committed the latest version of each listener.\\r\\n- `createListener` had a complex diffing process to ensure we stored the latest listeners, but this meant that the process had additional overhead and memory usage \u2013 which is no longer the case with this PR.\\r\\n- `createListener` required listeners to be put on nodes via the `listeners` prop. Furthermore, it required using arrays to combine multiple listeners, which some felt was not idealistic and might be confusing during debugging as to which listeners occurred at which stages. Also, there was general dislike to introducing another internal prop \u2013 as it would mean we\'d have to first forbid `listeners` and wait for React 17 to introduce these APIs, as they might be used in the wild for other reasons (custom elements).\\r\\n- `createListener` didn\'t provide an idiomatic way to conditionally add/remove root events (they\'re called delegated events in this new PR). With the new approach, there\'s a streamlined approach to ensure this is easier to do, and by default, no root events can be added unconditionally, which is a code-smell and a good cause of memory leaks/performance issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nTaking the above points into consideration, the design of this new event system aims at bringing the same capabilities as described in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17508 whilst also providing some other nice features, that should allow for bigger event sub-systems to be built on top.\\r\\n\\r\\n## `ReactDOM.useEvent`\\r\\n\\r\\nThis hook allows for the registration to a native DOM event, similar to that of `addEventListener` on the web. `useEvent` takes a given event `type` and registers it to the DOM then returns an object unique to that event that allows listeners to be attached to their targets in an effect or another event handler. The object provides three different methods to setup and handle listeners:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `setListener(target: window | element, listener: ?(Event => void))` set a listener to be active for a given DOM node. The node must be a DOM node managed by React or it can be the `window` node for delegation purposes. If the listener is `null` or `undefined` then we remove the given listener for that DOM node or `window` object.\\r\\n- `clear()` remove all listeners\\r\\n\\r\\nThe hook takes three arguments:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `type` the DOM event to listen to\\r\\n- `options` an optional object allowing for additional properties to be defined on the event listener. The options are:\\r\\n  - `passive` provide an optional flag that tells the listener to register a passive DOM event listener or an active DOM event listener\\r\\n  - `capture` provide an optional flag that tells the listener callback to fire in the capture phase or the bubble phase\\r\\n  - `priority` provide an optional Scheduler priority that allows React to correct schedule the listener callback to fire at the correct priority.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Note\\r\\n\\r\\nFor propagation, the same rules of `stopPropagation` and `stopImmediatePropagation` apply to these event listeners. These methods are actually monkey-patched, as we use the actual native DOM events with this system and API, rather than Synthetic Events. `currentTarget` and `eventPhase` are also respectfully monkey-patched to co-ordinate and align with the propagation system involved internally within React.\\r\\n\\r\\nFurthermore, all event listeners are passive by default. If is desired to called `event.preventDefault` on an event listener, then the event listener should be made active via the `passive` option.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Examples\\r\\n\\r\\nAn example of a basic clickable button:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport {useRef, useEffect} from \'react\';\\r\\nimport {useEvent} from \'react-dom\';\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction Button({children, onClick}) {\\r\\n  const buttonRef = useRef(null);\\r\\n  const clickEvent = useEvent(\'click\');\\r\\n\\r\\n  useEffect(() => {\\r\\n    clickEvent.setListener(buttonRef.current, onClick);\\r\\n  });\\r\\n\\r\\n  return <button ref={buttonRef}>{children}</button>;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to listen to events that are delegated to the window, you can do that:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport {useRef, useEffect} from \'react\';\\r\\nimport {useEvent} from \'react-dom\';\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction Button({children, onClick}) {\\r\\n  const clickEvent = useEvent(\'click\');\\r\\n\\r\\n  useEffect(() => {\\r\\n    // Pass in `window`, which is supported with this API\\r\\n    // Note: `window` is not supported, as React doesn\'t\\r\\n    // listen to events that high up.\\r\\n    clickEvent.setListener(window, onClick);\\r\\n  });\\r\\n\\r\\n  return <button>{children}</button>;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you wanted to extract the verbosity out of this into a custom hook, then it\'s possible to do so:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport {useRef, useEffect} from \'react\';\\r\\nimport {useEvent} from \'react-dom\';\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction useClick(ref, onClick) {\\r\\n  const clickEvent = useEvent(\'click\');\\r\\n\\r\\n  useEffect(() => {\\r\\n    clickEvent.setListener(ref.current, onClick);\\r\\n  });\\r\\n\\r\\n  return buttonRef;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction Button({children}) {\\r\\n  const buttonRef = useRef(null);\\r\\n  useClick(buttonRef , () => {\\r\\n    console.log(\'Hello world!\')\\r\\n  });\\r\\n  return <button ref={buttonRef}>{children}</button>;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nA more complex button that tracks when the button is being pressed with the mouse:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport {useRef, useEffect} from \'react\';\\r\\nimport {useEvent} from \'react-dom\';\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction Button({children, onClick}) {\\r\\n  const buttonRef = useRef(null);\\r\\n  const [pressed, setPressed] = useState(false);\\r\\n  const click = useEvent(\'click\');\\r\\n  const mouseUp = useEvent(\'mouseup\');\\r\\n  const mouseDown = useEvent(\'mousedown\');\\r\\n\\r\\n  useEffect(() => {\\r\\n    const button = buttonRef.current;\\r\\n\\r\\n    const handleMouseUp = () => {\\r\\n      setPressed(false);\\r\\n    };\\r\\n    const handleMouseDown = () => {\\r\\n      setPressed(true); \\r\\n    };\\r\\n\\r\\n    click.setListener(button, onClick);\\r\\n    if (pressed) {\\r\\n      mouseUp.setListener(button, handleMouseUp);\\r\\n    } else {\\r\\n      mouseDown.setListener(button, handleMouseDown);\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\n    return () => {\\r\\n      click.setListener(button, null);\\r\\n      mouseDown.setListener(button, null);\\r\\n      mouseUp.setListener(button, null);\\r\\n    };\\r\\n  }, [pressed, onClick]);\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <button ref={buttonRef} className={pressed && \'pressed\'}>\\r\\n      {children}\\r\\n    </button>\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## What about the DOM\'s `element.addEventListener`?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn many respects, this low-level API was intentionally designed to be a replacement for the DOM\'s `addEventListener`. Not only does this new Listener API provide many nice benefits, like auto-recycling listeners on unmount, but it should also help prevent bugs that will likely occur when `addEventListener` is used in conjunction with Concurrent Mode.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a detailed list of differences, here are just some of the key benefits of the Listener API vs the DOM\'s `addEventListener`:\\r\\n\\r\\n- The event listeners automatically get recycled upon unmount\\r\\n- The event listeners correctly batch updates and flush previous ones correctly, as well as co-ordinating priority levels with the internal scheduler\\r\\n- The event listeners allow for alignment with the propagation of other events in the React event system, something not possible with manual DOM event listeners\\r\\n- The event listeners will correctly work with React Portals, Suspense and Concurrent Mode, native event listeners do not.\\r\\n- By ensuring we use a hook, like useEvent, we can determine the event needed during server-side render and ensure those events are registered on initial hydration ahead of time. This makes it possible to \\"replay\\" those events before the components themselves have concurrently hydrated on the client.","created_at":"2019-12-18T19:19:12Z"},{"number":17650,"id":539857888,"title":"Mismatch in type definitions of ref prop and useRef hook","user":{"login":"Svish","id":142162},"state":"closed","body":"**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\n\\r\\nBug? \\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nWith Typescript strict mode turned on:\\r\\n\\r\\n```ts\\r\\nimport React, { useRef } from \'react\';\\r\\nfunction Img() {\\r\\n  const ref = useRef<HTMLImageElement>();\\r\\n  return <img ref={ref} src=\\"foobar\\" />\\r\\n//            ^^^ The type check error below\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nType \'MutableRefObject<HTMLImageElement | undefined>\' is not assignable to type \'string | ((instance: HTMLImageElement | null) => void) | RefObject<HTMLImageElement> | null | undefined\'.\\r\\n  Type \'MutableRefObject<HTMLImageElement | undefined>\' is not assignable to type \'RefObject<HTMLImageElement>\'.\\r\\n    Types of property \'current\' are incompatible.\\r\\n      Type \'HTMLImageElement | undefined\' is not assignable to type \'HTMLImageElement | null\'.\\r\\n        Type \'undefined\' is not assignable to type \'HTMLImageElement | null\'.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe expected type comes from property \'ref\' which is declared here on type \'DetailedHTMLProps<ImgHTMLAttributes<HTMLImageElement>, HTMLImageElement>\'\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nI would expect an empty ref like that to be acceptable, since (from what I can see) it works fine.

But on the web this won\'t be the case if you load React from CDN and *then* run your webpack bundle (https://github.com/pmmmwh/react-refresh-webpack-plugin/issues/13). And separating `<script>` tags can be annoying and complicated.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, we can handle the simple case \u2014 when ReactDOM executes before the webpack bundle \u2014 gracefully.

If you keep them, they\'ll be there. We *do* have a linter plugin that tells you to wrap it in DEV. I audited existing cases where it fails, and added suppressions where it was intentional.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Stack Is Injected Automatically\\r\\n\\r\\nYou don\'t need to choose whether to inject the stack. If you use `console.error`, it will be injected automatically, as long as the package from which you\'re calling it has access to the React object. Alternatively, it will keep your `console.error` as is in the source (no stack). DevTools would likely pick it up though anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: in the future we might completely remove the stack injection and always rely on DevTools and similar mechanisms (e.g. RN integration) to inject it.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Escape Hatches\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you want to use the \\"raw\\" `console.error` or `console.warn` for whatever reason, you can do it like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nconsole[\'error\'](\'hahaha\');\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis will use the native `console.error` *in DEV too*. Practically, this means we won\'t try to append the stack, prepend the `Warning:` marker (which is currently relied on by RN), or go through the WWW whitelist. There\'s only a few places that we do this.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Gotchas\\r\\n\\r\\nWe have two modules that don\'t have access to the isomorphic React package: `scheduler` and `react-is`. So we can\'t append the stacks. **This means `console.error` calls inside of these two packages won\'t get transformed even in DEV for real bundles \u2014 <s>they\'ll stay as `console.error`.** But in our tests, they would be transformed.</s> (I changed this to fail the build.)\\r\\n\\r\\nWe barely have any warnings there, and both are meant to be lightweight. So I think it\'s okay. The fact that they don\'t go through the WWW list can be confusing. But in longer term we want to get rid of the special `warning` entry point altogether. In that world, we would have the list be a list of warnings to *mute*, and pass everything else through.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo get there, we\'ll need to enforce that the React warning list\xa0matches WWW list 1:1. We\'d need to get buy-in from other teams for that to work out. In the meantime, I don\'t expect we\'ll add a lot of new warnings to either `scheduler` or `react-is` anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this gotcha ends up being a pain, we can always have a second \\"compile target\\" that exists solely to make these warnings go through the WWW list anyway.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Risks\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s sync WWW carefully after this. We need to verify nothing broke and warnings still fire. I can do this.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Follow-ups\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of scope of this PR, but after landing this I\'m planning to rename `toWarnDev` to `toErrorDev` (because it\'s for `console.error`), and `toLowPriorityWarnDev` to `toWarnDev` (because it\'s for `console.warn`). Then I plan to audit the warnings and split them into these two levels according to whether they represent real issues or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally, I\'ll remove the cases where we detect presence of custom stack first before appending it. Instead, we\'ll set the current fiber.","created_at":"2019-12-13T19:57:56Z"},{"number":17598,"id":537527306,"title":"variable declaration is not working in eval","user":{"login":"mayank-kansal15","id":19771478},"state":"closed","body":"eval(var a = 10); console.log(b)\\r\\nthis works in normal javascript code and variable is declared in outer scope.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut when I do the same in the render function, it doesn\'t work.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome react Guru please help.","created_at":"2019-12-13T12:35:19Z"},{"number":17597,"id":537495570,"title":"ReactFiberBeginWork: finishClassComponent: \u0441heck `instance` before call of `instance.render`","user":{"login":"vithar","id":171723},"state":"closed","body":"https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b15bf36750ca4c4a5a09f2de76c5315ded1258d0/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L845\\r\\n\\r\\nIn function `finishClassComponent` in some cases `const instance = workInProgress.stateNode` can be `undefined`.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo you need to check `instance` before call `instance.render()`\\r\\n","created_at":"2019-12-13T11:21:27Z"},{"number":17596,"id":537455833,"title":"onContextMenu event does not get fired on iOS 13.1","user":{"login":"Finomnis","id":3129043},"state":"closed","body":"\x3c!--\\r\\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\\r\\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\\r\\n--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\nbug\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\nonContextMenu event does not get fired on iOS 13.1 when long-pressing on an iPhone.\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/awesome-wilson-t1yy3\\r\\n\\r\\nClicking the gray rectangle should print \'onClick\', which it does on all platforms I tested.\\r\\nLong-pressing/right-clicking on the gray rectangle should print \'onContextMenu\', which it does on windows and android, but not on iOS.

This makes diagnosing and fixing render performance issues much more difficult.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, yesterday I was debugging an app where each render usually took 10ms-20ms except every 20-30 renders it\'d take 600-800ms.  It was frustrating that I didn\'t have a way to correlate the profiler UI (which told me which renders were problematic) with the verbose console log output that might tell me exactly what went wrong during those renders. Instead I had to comb through logs and guess which output came from \\"bad\\" renders. This was tedious and error-prone.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnyway, my proposal is for React DevTools to make it easy to correlate profiler results with console log output.  Both directions would be useful:\\r\\n1) **navigate from logs to profiler** - if I see a suspicious line in the logs, I\'d like to easily navigate to the profiler with the specific component/commit selected that was running when the line was logged.\\r\\n2) **navigate from profiler to logs** - if I see a suspiciously long commit, I\'d like to select it in the profiler pane and have an easy way to see associated logs.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\'t have a strong opinion about how this should be accomplished, but below are a few ideas to spur discussion.\\r\\n\\r\\nA minimal solution could be something like this: \\r\\na) The profiler assigns a unique ID to each commit\\r\\nb) The profiler\'s right pane would show the ID for each commit\\r\\nc) React would add a new hook that\'d return that ID\\r\\nd) Userland code could include the ID in logs.\\r\\n\\r\\nJust this minimal support would be a vast improvement.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we wanted to make it smoother, here\'s a few ideas that could be layered on top.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. **Profiler->Console Links** The ID in the profiler UI could be a hyperlink that\'d open the console drawer and put the ID in the console\'s CMD+F search box. This would be one-click navigation from profiler to logs. I don\'t know if Chrome allows this kind of cross-pane control, over the console UI so this might not be practical.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. **Console -> Profiler Links**  For one-click logging in the other direction., we could have a special URL format (e.g. `react://profiler/commit/2c1056b5-1be1-43d4-a105-1d840cf4f9c3`) that would enable userland code to emit links in the console that, when clicked, would navigate to the specific commit (in the profile pane) that was active when the logs were emitted. Similar caveat as above: I\'m not sure if chrome extensions can be \\"deeplinked\\" like this. \\r\\n\\r\\n3. **Log Components Where** Building on (1) and (2) above, we could enable console<->profiler linking without requiring changes to userland code. We could have a profiler setting (e.g. \\"log components where\\" with UX like \\"hide components where\\") that, when active, would emit a line to the console log at the start of each render of a matching component. The output would link back to the profiler, e.g. \\r\\n`[RDT] Starting MyCoolComponent (react://profiler/commit/2c1056b51be143d4a1051d840cf4f9c3)`.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat do you think? I\'m unfamiliar with React and RDT internals so there might be much better ways to solve log<->profiler correlation than my naive ideas above. But at least I wanted to call out the problem and encourage discussion about a solution.\\r\\n","created_at":"2019-12-13T09:01:35Z"},{"number":17593,"id":537392076,"title":"validateDOMNesting incorrectly validates <tr> - children of <table>","user":{"login":"mukkurum","id":11518664},"state":"closed","body":"**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\n\\r\\nbug.\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nvalidateDOMNesting shows warning when`<tr>` used as a child of  `<table>`, after any `<caption>`, `<colgroup>` and `<thead>` but only if there no `<tbody>` are children of the `<table>`.\\r\\n\\r\\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.

This adds component stacks to all warnings except the ones where a package doesn\'t have peer or dep on React (such as `react-is`). Concretely, we switch over from `warningWithoutStack` to `warning`, and from `lowPriorityWarningWithoutStack` to `lowPriorityWarning`, wherever possible. Tests are adjusted accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are three reasons for this.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Stacks are generally useful. More and consistent is better.\\r\\n1. We want to move towards just writing `console.error` and `console.warn` in the source code, and having a Babel plugin call the wrapper with extra logic. So it\'s inconvenient to have this distinction.\\r\\n1. Even for warnings that don\'t *currently* have stacks, they\'re actually already being added by React DevTools anyway. So the distinction hasn\'t mattered for a while.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat if the stack is misleading or not concrete enough? For example, maybe we have a better stack we want to pass. We do the same thing DevTools does in that case. If the last argument *already* looks like a component stack, we don\'t append an extra one.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotably, this adds component stacks to SSR hydration mismatch warnings. They can still sometimes be misleading but it\'s better than nothing.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome tests still have `{withoutStack: true}`. This is not because we *can\'t* emit them, but because in those particular tests we\'re just not inside of a tree. So we\'re keeping the assertion mechanism for that to avoid regressions.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn a follow-up, I will codemod to `console.error` / `console.warn` calls and a Babel plugin for the wrappers. This will also allow us to choose the right version of the wrapper depending on whether a package depends on React or not.","created_at":"2019-12-12T14:25:12Z"},{"number":17585,"id":536982614,"title":"[react-events] Remove lastNativeEvent in favor of EventSystemFlags","user":{"login":"trueadm","id":1519870},"state":"closed","body":"This is a follow up to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17582.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotably, this removes the usage of storing the `lastNativeEvent` in a binding in the EnterLeavePlugin module \u2013 which can leak memory.

This sequence of PRs is to optimize the paths React executes in such cases.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nHow it\'s implemented\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n(There might be errors/a lack of understanding in this description)\\r\\n\\r\\n`unstable_avoidThisRender()` is called during the render phase, which is similar to the \'throw\' phase (without the actual throwing). When this happens:\\r\\n- we look for the nearest Suspense boundary (that satisfies hasInvisibleParentBoundary === true), \\r\\n- and mark it\'s `effectTag` as `SoftCapture` (which is a variant of `DidCapture` for avoided renders). \\r\\n- We also attach a ping listener for cleaning up if the thenable resolves before we commit that boundary.\\r\\n\\r\\n(These steps are similar to what we\'d call if you threw an actual promise; ie - `throwException()`)\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after this, `completeWork` is called for the marked Suspense boundary. We use this instant to mark the boundary as expired, and return itself to render itself again.\\r\\n\\r\\nSoon after, beginWork is called for that boundary. `SoftCapture` tells us that boundary has suspended. We clear the effectTag, initialize suspenseState/memoizedState on that boundary, and set `expirationTime` and `memoizedState.didAvoidRenderTime` as `renderExpirationTime - 1`; ie - we mark that boundary as \'expiring very soon\'. \\r\\n\\r\\nSoon `unstable_avoidThisRender()` is called again, setting the effectTag back to `SoftCapture`. (This time in completeWork, we see that the effectTag and memoizedState are set, so can bypass returning itself.) \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter committing, the content rerender happens. (???) \\r\\n\\r\\nThis time, in `completeWork()`, we call `renderDidSuspendDelayIfPossible()` to set the exit status on the tree.

(I am writing a library so no idea what clients might need from the event - caching its properties is not an option.)\\r\\n\\r\\nYet, in most cases, it is well established when these events are no longer needed.

I can\'t think of any reason for this behavior to be against react best practices, but the react devs are much smarter than me and have probably thought much longer and harder about this than I have. If this is too trivial or not worth the react devs\' time, please close right away.\\r\\n\\r\\nBasically, I\'m proposing allowing for easy prop binding, similar to using `Function.bind()` or `Function.apply()`/`call()`. This would make it easier to pass props down when the component needs to be passed down directly, like in a prop to another component, like what react router does, and not as JSX. An example I found in my own code (`history` comes from react-router):\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n// search-bar.js\\r\\nexport default function SearchBar({className: outerClassName, Result = noopJsx, search, ...props}) {\\r\\n    return <div className={outerClassName}>\\r\\n        ... bar JSX\\r\\n        <Results Result={Result} results={results} {...props} />;\\r\\n    </div>;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nResults.propTypes = {Result: PropTypes.func, results: PropTypes.object};\\r\\n    function Results({Result, results, ...props}) {\\r\\n        return <div css={resultsStyles}>\\r\\n            {Object.entries(results || {}).map(([name, result]) =>\\r\\n                <Result key={name} name={name} result={result} {...props} />)}\\r\\n      </div>;\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n// custom-search-bar.js\\r\\nCustomSearchBar.propTypes = {history: PropTypes.object};\\r\\nexport default function CustomSearchBar({history}) {\\r\\n    Result.propTypes = {name: PropTypes.string};\\r\\n\\r\\n    return <SearchBar Result={Result} search={search} />;\\r\\n\\r\\n    function Result({name}) {\\r\\n        const url = \'/other-page.js\';\\r\\n        const go = () => history.push(url);\\r\\n\\r\\n        return <div onClick={go}>\\r\\n            ... inner content\\r\\n        </div>;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction search() {\\r\\n    // custom search function\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nSorry if this is a little complicated, but basically there is a generic search bar and a more custom one. The custom one isn\'t too fancy, but it has a \\"history\\" prop, which comes from react-router. The history prop is used in the Result component, but because Result is a prop, any props passed to it must be in scope.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow, one way to resolve this is to make the Result prop into a function, as components are just functions. For example,\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n    <SearchBar Result={({...props) => <Result history={history} {...props} />} />\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nor\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nexport function SearchBar({Result, ...rest}) {\\r\\n    ...snip\\r\\n    <SearchBar Result={WrappedResult} />\\r\\n\\r\\n    function WrappedResult({...props}) {\\r\\n        return <Result history={history} {...props} />;\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nbut I feel like this is too complicated for such a simple task. I admit I haven\'t seen too many other places where this could be useful, but this is a relatively simple site.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'m sure there are multiple ways this could be resolved, and this was a pretty early react component for me, though I had been coding in angular 1 for a while before that. If I were doing this site over, I might do something completely different that ignores this problem entirely. My point is, has this space ever been looked at?\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\'t want to assume anything about the amount of work involved, and I\'m not sure how often this would be used. That said, could we have something like `bindProps`? For example,\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n    <SearchBar Result={Result.bindProps({history})} />\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nDepending on how the partial application proposal (currently stage 1) goes, this may not be needed in react after all. For example, it might be as simple as:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n    <SearchBar Result={Result({history: ?}) />\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nSo what do you think? Has this ever been looked at? What alternatives were proposed, which I\'m sure were much better than mine? Does my proposal have any merit whatsoever?\\r\\n\\r\\nBy the way, I have read how easy react makes things like prototyping and demoing code, but I ever realized how easy until I wrote this issue.

I went digging in the hooks code and found this [line](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberHooks.js#L871), which appears to be sealing the `ref` object only when it is in dev.

Specifically, the Flare event system has the notion of \\"root events\\" that are meant to be triggered when an incoming dispatched event gets bubbled to the document. Upon hitting the document, we then check a global Map, to see if there are any active event responders listening to the given type of event coming through.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe issue is that this Map can\'t be GC\'d when DOM nodes are detached and removed, because we need to iterate over the Map\'s values to get all active responders that listen to root events. Normally, this wouldn\'t be an issue, but because of the heuristics as to how React reconciles responders differently depending on initial render vs update render, the root events can be subscribed to, but never used due to unwinding and other characteristics within the reconciliation processes. The expectation is that things that occur in initial render should be effects that can be unwound simply due to the nature of the garbage collector, but because of the nature of how root events work \u2013 this will never be the case (we need to be able to iterate over root events on any given incoming dispatch event, which means we can\'t use a WeakMap or WeakSet).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the ideal world, no root event listeners should be created on initial render. Unfortunately, this is likely to be a more complex and feature breaking change to make at this point given the requirements of the Focus and FocusWithin event responders, which both make use of root events on initial mount. This PR tackles the problem in a somewhat brute-force approach, by moving all React Flare responders to the commit phase, at the compromise of more commit phase work vs the benefit of no leaking of the root event Map.\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe this is probably the best short-term solution, and a lesson we can take forward in ironing out kinks with the newer Listener API. We can also, in the short-term, possibly come up with a way of remove root events from event responders on initial mount and finding a way to make them work conditionally, but this will likely take a larger period of time. In the interests of unblocking this memory leak, this seems the most sane path forward at this point.","created_at":"2019-12-04T01:56:44Z"},{"number":17517,"id":532358786,"title":"Stale values for useState inside callback functions","user":{"login":"alex-cory","id":5455859},"state":"closed","body":"\x3c!--\\r\\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\\r\\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\\r\\n--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\npotential bug\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\nWhen calling `setState` from `useState`, the `state` value is stale from inside a function.

Note: For now this is only intended to be used internally at Facebook, and we have no initial plans to ship this to open source.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe listener API includes its own React event system that leverages the lessons learned from the existing event system and that of the experimental React Flare event system. There are three new APIs that are added to `react-dom`:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `ReactDOM.unstable_createListener`\\r\\n- `ReactDOM.unstable_createRootListener`\\r\\n- `ReactDOM.unstable_addEventPriority`\\r\\n\\r\\nThe Listener API works in a similar way to the DOM\'s `addEventListener` API, except this API returns a special React Listener object that can be supplied to elements via the internal `listeners` prop. An example of this follows:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport React from \'react\';\\r\\nimport {unstable_createListener} from \'react-dom\';\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction ClickableButton({ text }) {\\r\\n  const click = unstable_createListener(\'click\', event => {\\r\\n    console.log(\'You clicked the button, event\');\\r\\n  });\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <button listeners={click}>{text}</button>\\r\\n  ); \\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Listener Options\\r\\n\\r\\nBoth the `createListener` and `createRootListener` APIs support an optional third argument for specifying listener options. There are two boolean options that can be specified, `capture` and `passive`. Here\'s an example to demonstrate this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nfunction ClickableButton({ text }) {\\r\\n  const options = {\\r\\n    capture: true, // capture is `false` by default\\r\\n    passive: true, // passive is `true` by default\\r\\n  };\\r\\n  const click = unstable_createListener(\'click\', event => {\\r\\n    console.log(\'You clicked the button, event\');\\r\\n  }, options);\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <button listeners={click}>{text}</button>\\r\\n  ); \\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Root Listeners\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes, it\'s ideal to attach listeners to the root document of an app, so events can be captured that don\'t hit a specific target element. For these cases, the `createRootListener` API can be used:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport React from \'react\';\\r\\nimport {unstable_createRootListener} from \'react-dom\';\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction ClickableButton({ text }) {\\r\\n  const click = unstable_createRootListener(\'click\', event => {\\r\\n    console.log(\'You clicked the button, event\');\\r\\n  });\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <button listeners={click}>{text}</button>\\r\\n  ); \\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Combining multiple listeners\\r\\n\\r\\nElements support having multiple listeners, even of the same type on an element, to do this, arrays can be used (and nested) to supply many listeners. Listeners of the same type will execute in array order of how they\'re supplied to the element:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nfunction ClickableButton({ text }) {\\r\\n  const click = unstable_createListener(\'click\', event => {\\r\\n    ...\\r\\n  });\\r\\n  const click2 = unstable_createListener(\'click\', event => {\\r\\n    ...\\r\\n  });\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <button listeners={[click, click2]}>{text}</button>\\r\\n  ); \\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Event Object\\r\\n\\r\\nUnlike the existing React event system, the Listener API supplies only the native object to event callbacks \u2013 there are no Synthetic Events. The only caveat is that the native objects get monkey-patched by React, with several of the properties and methods on the event object replaced with alternatives that interface with React\'s event delegation and propagation system. Calling `stopPropagation` on the monkey-patched event object will not trigger the native `stopPropagation` method (unlike the existing React event system, which does), but rather prevent propagation through React\'s propagation system only.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Event Flushing\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the Listener API, we don\'t flush on the native event triggering unless we have React Listeners that are actually triggered, this should help reduce needlessly flushing work when the event has no actual action.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR depends on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17513","created_at":"2019-12-03T11:41:06Z"},{"number":17507,"id":531801092,"title":"Error: \\"Could not find node with id \\"18486\\" in commit tree\\"","user":{"login":"boteeka","id":877397},"state":"closed","body":"Describe what you were doing when the bug occurred:\\r\\n1.

I\u2019ll try to summarize the conversation so far below.\\n\\nThe basic question was whether a build tool could extract the static parts of a component tree ahead of time into HTML, and ship smaller JS to the client with only the dynamic parts. This could have benefits for code size and hydration performance for statically generated sites. It would likely have a smaller impact on dynamically generated server rendered sites, but it\u2019s possible there are static parts that could be extracted there too (e.g. header, footer, article content, etc.).\\n\\nThere are a couple potential ways to go about this, each with various tradeoffs.\\n\\n1. Do something like what ember and other template compilers do and generate some kind of IR from components and inject dynamic content into slots at runtime. This would likely require a lot of changes to React itself. @aweary seems to be working on some kind of [compiler](https://twitter.com/aweary/status/1199867044532903937?s=21) to do just that.\\n2. Rewrite the JS with something like prepack, similar to what @trueadm did [here](https://github.com/trueadm/ssr-with-prepack-hackathon) (though it sounded like the output was quite variable in size).\\n3. Rewrite the component tree to generate a different but equivalent tree with the static parts hoisted out. Similar to this [babel plugin](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/babel-react-optimize) but taken much farther to work at a whole tree level instead of a component level. Also to remove the static parts from JS altogether and generate static HTML to avoid duplicate content in JS and unnecessary hydration cost. Some way to allow static HTML in the middle of a tree to be reused might be needed, but maybe compiling to multiple roots would work?\\n\\nObviously a lot more thought is needed here. As @gaearon noted, a solid definition of \u201cstatic\u201d will be important for this discussion. Mine is that it could be rendered to HTML and never updated by JS, but perhaps people have other ideas.","created_at":"2019-11-28T03:05:50Z"},{"number":17478,"id":529570980,"title":"Change DevTools hook warning message","user":{"login":"gaearon","id":810438},"state":"closed","body":"Out of these 4 devtools injection points, 3 are used by Fast Refresh, and 3 are used by DevTools.

However, our company\'s data fetching is subscription-oriented: At a very high level, the following happens:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Component renders, and calls `useFoo(id, \'name\', \'amount\', \'discounts\');`\\r\\n2. Internally, the hook adds a callback to the `FooLoader` which is responsible for batching and sending async requests. The callback will invoke the setter for a `useState` inside the hook to force a rerender of the consuming component. \\r\\n3. The hook returns a [`RemoteData<Pick<Foo, \'name\' | \'amount\' | \'discounts\'>>`](https://github.com/ExtraHop/ts-remote-data) which could contain the data if it was locally available, or is just a constant that says, \\"I haven\'t asked for this data yet\\"\\r\\n4. When the data becomes available, or the request for the data fails, the `FooLoader` invokes the hook-passed-in callback method, which triggers the rerender, which presents the new component state.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt no point in there does the component have a `Promise`. As a result, I\'m not sure it\'s possible for it to throw anything; it\'s depending on the `useState` inside `useFoo` to trigger rerender when data is available, but if we throw then that never happens and we wouldn\'t ever complete.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrowing a `Promise` from inside the hook doesn\'t seem right, as it would be very difficult to combine multiple data dependencies in a single component.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only alternative seems to be a pretty sizable plumbing change to return a `Promise` instead of the loading state constant, but that seems to force a lot of allocations and boilerplate code to handle the \\"maybe not ready the first time\\" case.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: Posting in response to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1194434908984414208) by @gaearon ","created_at":"2019-11-26T19:15:10Z"},{"number":17465,"id":528909890,"title":"Error: \\"Could not find node with id \\"113994\\" in commit tree\\"","user":{"login":"qoalu","id":1624045},"state":"closed","body":"Describe what you were doing when the bug occurred:\\r\\n1.

(skip for now)\\r\\n- [x] add `module` fields to packages\\r\\n\\r\\n## Artifacts\\r\\nBundles may be configured with the additional build targets `ESM_DEV` and `ESM_PROD`. The build output will generate the following files:\\r\\n```\\r\\nesm/<package_name>.development.mjs\\r\\nesm/<package_name>.production.min.mjs\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Module Entry\\r\\nPackages that support ESM are structured using the [Dual CommonJS/ESModules Pattern](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v13.x/docs/api/esm.html#esm_dual_commonjs_es_module_packages) using the conditional exports feature.\\r\\n\\r\\nPackages may define an `__exports` field to support ESM. This is prefixed with a double-underscore to avoid file resolution issues with build. (e.g. import <package/src/x> will break if exports is set during build).  During build each package\'s __exports field is assigned into the `exports` field of the final build.\\r\\n\\r\\nPackages may also define top-level `.mjs` files in the `npm/` folders, similar to how they currently include top-level `index.js` files. These can be used to define the modular API.\\r\\n\\r\\n```json5\\r\\n{\\r\\n   \\"name\\": \\"react-x\\",\\r\\n   \\"version\\": \\"16.derp\\",\\r\\n   \\"main\\": \\"index.js\\",\\r\\n  // will be turned into \\"exports\\" in build step\\r\\n   \\"__exports\\": { \\r\\n     // top-level import is under \\".\\"\\r\\n      \\".\\": {\\r\\n         // Note: relative imports are important here\\r\\n         \\"require\\": \\"./index.js\\",\\r\\n         \\"default\\": \\"./index.mjs\\"\\r\\n      },\\r\\n      \\"./subpath_import\\": {\\r\\n         \\"require: \\"./subpath_import.js\\",\\r\\n         \\"require: \\"./subpath_import.mjs\\",\\r\\n      }\\r\\n   }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n### Verification\\r\\nModule structure is verified with a new script: test-package-structure, which is performed after the packages are built. This script depends on NodeJS >= 13.2 with the`--experimantal-conditional-exports` flag. The goal of this script is to ensure that packages are aligned with future NodeJS specifications for ES Modules. This script verifies the following invariants over each built package:\\r\\n\\r\\n* If `main` field is present in package.json, the file it references exists.\\r\\n* If an `exports` specification exists in package.json, the files it references exist.\\r\\n* The entries in `files` for each package.json exist.\\r\\n* The package can be included with a `require` statement\\r\\n* Each entry in `exports` can be included with `require()` and `import()`\\r\\n\\r\\nSample Output:\\r\\nsample package validator output:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n\ud83d\udce6 create-subscription\\r\\n\\t\u2713 pkg.main

The work I do or have pretty much always done in React involves dealing with streams of data, generally coming over a web socket. What will it look like? Will it be easy for users to implement/use? Is a promise/thenable an appropriate type for dealing with this even internally, given that the first value may never show up?\\r\\n\\r\\n### Desire\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ability to leverage suspense to \\"suspend\\" until the first of many values arrives from a stream of data coming from any source. For the sake of conversation, we\'ll say a web socket.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n### Constraints\\r\\n\\r\\n- The first value may never arrive\\r\\n- The source may close without error, having never provided a value\\r\\n- There must be an ergonomic teardown mechanism, for example how developers can currently teardown in the returned function of `useEffect` or in `componentWillUnmount`.\\r\\n- There may be more than one value returned by the streaming source\\r\\n\\r\\n### Optional constraints\\r\\n\\r\\n- The first N values form the source may be synchronous (followed by asynchronous values)\\r\\n\\r\\n### Scenario\\r\\n\\r\\nA simple app with two routes, one where the app needs to open a web socket connection and collect streaming data, and the other where the socket connection should be closed. The values from the web socket may take long enough that the developer will want to move to that routed component right away and show some spinner with suspense until the first bit of data arrives. If the user navigates to the first route, then leaves before the first value arrives, what happens?\\r\\n\\r\\nMy concern is, that if, even internally, the mechanism is a promise or thenable, there is a chance leaks will be created in the event that the source of that first value is torn down before the first value arrives. The only way, with a thenable or promise, to avoid that chance would be to make sure that the teardown mechanism was somehow tied to the thenable, so that the thenable to be rejected (or resolved) with a known value, such that it will be \\"settled\\".","created_at":"2019-11-22T16:19:21Z"},{"number":17435,"id":527243911,"title":"Rejecting suspended promise does not automatically go to an error boundary","user":{"login":"kentcdodds","id":1500684},"state":"open","body":"**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\n\\r\\nIf [what @gaearon said is true](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1197853310470021120), then it\'s a bug of unstable software.\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a suspending promise rejects, it does not automatically trigger an error boundary and instead it suspends forever: https://codesandbox.io/s/suspenselist-issues-u9brv\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1500684/69435887-9daf6c00-0cfd-11ea-89b3-86d5368155f5.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\'s the gist of the code:\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nlet promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>\\r\\n  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error(\'failed\')), 1000),\\r\\n)\\r\\nfunction SuspendingComponent() {\\r\\n  throw promise\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// ...\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction App() {\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <div>\\r\\n      <ErrorBoundary>\\r\\n        <Suspense fallback=\\"loading...\\">\\r\\n          <SuspendingComponent />\\r\\n        </Suspense>\\r\\n      </ErrorBoundary>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n  )\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on Dan\'s tweet, I would expect that when the promise rejects, the error boundary would be rendered, but it\'s not.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\'s a simple workaround: https://codesandbox.io/s/suspenselist-issues-fxven\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'m having trouble with that showing the actual error on codesandbox, but here\'s what it looks like locally:\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1500684/69435832-87091500-0cfd-11ea-8012-0010c3ee2c38.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gist of the changes:\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nlet status = \'pending\'\\r\\nlet result\\r\\nlet promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) =>\\r\\n  setTimeout(() => reject(new Error(\'failed\')), 1000),\\r\\n).then(\\r\\n  r => {\\r\\n    result = r\\r\\n    status = \'success\'\\r\\n  },\\r\\n  e => {\\r\\n    result = e\\r\\n    status = \'error\'\\r\\n  },\\r\\n)\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction SuspendingComponent() {\\r\\n  if (status === \'pending\') throw promise\\r\\n  if (status === \'error\') throw result\\r\\n  return result\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe workaround is basically to store the error and throw it during the render phase.

The current implementation doesn\'t do this properly. It has a hidden assumption that, when rebasing, the next `renderExpirationTime` will represent a later expiration time that the original one. That\'s usually true, but it\'s not *always* true: there could be another update at even higher priority.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis requires two extra fields on the update queue. I really don\'t like that the update queue logic has gotten even more complicated. It\'s tempting to say that we should remove rebasing entirely, and that update queues must always be updated at the same priority. But I\'m hesitant to jump to that conclusion \u2014 rebasing can be confusing in the edge cases, but it\'s also convenient. Enforcing single-priority queues would really hurt the ergonomics of useReducer, for example, where multiple values are centralized in a single queue. It especially hurts the ergonomics of classes, where there\'s only a single queue per class.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it\'s something to think about, but I don\'t think \\"no more rebasing\\" is an acceptable answer on its own.","created_at":"2019-11-21T22:22:21Z"},{"number":17429,"id":526869512,"title":"React warnings should use console.warn and allow verbosity override.","user":{"login":"cchamberlain","id":424694},"state":"closed","body":"\x3c!--\\r\\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\\r\\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\\r\\n--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\nRequest a feature (though reporting warnings via `console.error` has always struck me as odd).\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\nAfter React upgrades and intermittently during development React deprecation and other warnings accrue and React displays them along with the entire call stack via `console.error`. We eventually pay down the debt by updating all the call points but this isn\'t something seen as very high priority (actual bugs / certain features / genuine errors are priority). In the meantime the chrome dev console is inundated with warnings masquerading as errors.\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/424694/69380814-267bc880-0c68-11ea-96ec-113bc5a6111c.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\nThese should be appropriately reported via `console.warn`. This is the standard used for deprecation warnings in chrome. Reporting these as errors makes legitimate errors more difficult to spot, especially due to the fact that the entire call stack is dropped into the message. With the stack trace in the message, each one takes the entire screen of chrome dev tools, where legitimate errors correctly fold the stack trace and take a fraction of the real estate. Reporting warnings via `console.error` when no error is thrown is not a good practice. It feels a bit like React is yelling at me in all caps to \\"FIX ME NOW\\" and clearly thinks its more important than other things (like actual errors). Further, reporting as errors breaks the functionality of chrome dev tools verbosity filters in that I can\'t focus on actual errors when I want to, nor can I focus on sitewide warnings (including React).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are times when reporting these as errors would be useful - when I\'m doing dedicated work to fix React deprecations. I separate work into separate PRs and often do not want to fix one-off deprecations when I\'m working on something unrelated. Often, these warnings cannot be fixed without testing them thoroughly (anything with `setState` / `componentWillMount` / etc.).\\r\\n\\r\\nI propose allowing some configuration such as `process.env.REACT_THROW_WARNINGS` / `process.env.REACT_TREAT_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS` / `process.env.REACT_STRICT` (or possibly even allowing a verbosity level to report them at). If this flag were enabled, the warnings should actually be thrown, breaking the app, and the call stack would not need to be appended to the message. The default state should report the warning with `console.warn` and elide the call stack. The warning message could contain a note / link describing how to elevate warnings to actual errors.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf all the above is deemed \\"by design\\" or whatever, it would be really nice if React could expose a warning formatter middleware to let us override the massive call stack to cap its head to 3-5 lines.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

This should be fine, but it can be a problem when used with React.lazy because the dynamic import isn\'t started until the lazy component is rendered so adding a SuspenseList to an existing set of lazily loaded components results in a slower overall loading experience thanks to a waterfall effect.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor completeness I\'ll just add that this same thing applies to \\"backwards\\" as an option as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nI understand why SuspenseList doesn\'t bother rendering components in Suspense Boundaries until they\'re ready to be shown. It\'s because we should be firing requests for things before we try to render the components that need those resources. However, React.lazy is a bit of a special case because it doesn\'t suspend until it\'s rendered the first time and for the developer to fire that request eagerly requires extra work on the part of the developer (there\'s a comment in the code showing the workaround).\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nBecause React.lazy is a special case and people are likely to run into this gotcha a lot when implementing Suspense Lists around lazy components, I think something should be done for these to start loading the module eagerly without workarounds.

Specifically: `onDetachedVisibleNode` -> `onBeforeFocusedElementDetached `\\r\\n- Provides another callback that lets the user know the active blur has occurred on the removed node, this event is `onFocusedElementDetached `.\\r\\n- Fixes a bug where where a focused active element is removed as part of a larger sub-tree, where the active element isn\'t removed directly, but an ancestor above it is. We now use the `beforeRemoveInstance` to correctly unify this logic (removing it from the `removeChild` and `removeChildFromContainer` methods)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Why do we need two events? What is the for?\\r\\n\\r\\nThese callbacks are to help with our experimental internal accessibility work at Facebook. There are various ways to tackle this problem. I\'ve been working closely with @tatermelon (Tatiana from the accessibility team) to guide this implementation internally and apply it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem these tackle are when active elements (elements that are focused on the document) are unmounted. This is a big problem with accessibility and it\'s been a big problem that folks have tried to tackle for a while with hacks. The realism is that there\'s no real good way to do this in user-land today, which is evident by how many websites simply don\'t handle this use-case.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis problem is made more evident with the introduction of Suspense fallbacks, where content if focused for a spinner, but is then removed to show the actual real content after X time.

See #17066.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe underlying problem\\r\\n----------------------\\r\\n\\r\\nThe implicit contract of `flushPassiveEffects` is that, right after calling it, there should be no pending passive effects. In the normal case, in concurrent mode, this is true. But the current implementation fails to account for the case where a passive effect schedules synchronous work, which in turn schedules additional passive effects.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis led to `rootWithPendingPassiveEffects` being overwritten in the commit phase, because an assignment that assumed it was replacing null was actually replacing a reference to another root, which has the consequence of dropping passive effects on that root.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fix\\r\\n-------\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fix I\'ve chosen here is, at the beginning of the commit phase, keep flushing passive effects in a loop until there are no more.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis doesn\'t not change the \\"public\\" implementation of `flushPassiveEffects`, though it arguably should work this way, too. I say \\"public\\" because it\'s only used by implementation layers on top of React which we control: mainly, the legacy version of `act` that does not use the mock Scheduler build. So there\'s probably still a bug in that `act` implementation.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will address `act` in a follow-up. The ideal solution is to replace the legacy `act` with one implemented directly in the renderer, using a special testing-only build of React DOM. Since that requires a breaking change, we\'ll need an interim solution. We could make the \\"public\\" `act`\\r\\nrecursively flush effects in a loop, as I\'ve done for the commit phase. However, I think a better solution is to stop automatically flushing the synchronous update queue at the end of `flushPassiveEffects`, and instead require the caller to explicitly call `flushSyncUpdateQueue` (or the equivalent) if needed. This follows the same pattern we use internally in the work loop, which is designed to avoid factoring hazards like the one that resulted in this bug.","created_at":"2019-11-12T03:06:20Z"},{"number":17346,"id":521180114,"title":"[Native] If statement cleanup for null targets","user":{"login":"TheSavior","id":249164},"state":"closed","body":"@SVladikO [flagged](https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/2c6ea0b3ffffd1a110845327262ecea59ee48dab#r35901865) that this code could be refactored to be a bit cleaner.

Support","user":{"login":"sebmarkbage","id":63648},"state":"closed","body":"This adds basic Suspense support to Flight by streaming the response.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst it sends one line with the root JSON model. Within the model holes are replaced with \\"$\\" followed by a hex ID. E.g. \\"$12AB3\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSubsequent lines begin with \\"J\\" followed by a hex ID.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo an example response may look something like:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n{\\"some\\":{\\"json\\":\\"$1\\"},data:[\\"$1\\",\\"$2\\"]}\\r\\nJ1:{\\"more\\":\\"data\\"}\\r\\nJ2:{\\"even\\":\\"more\\"}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe client suspends if you try to access an unresolved value. Once a new line comes in it unsuspends that part of the model.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently this suspending is implemented as a getter but it could also be a Proxy. However, more likely is that we\'ll hide this behind an explicit API that unwraps both components and its data in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Errors\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the server errors while rendering one of the models that error is encoded with an \\"E\\" prefix:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n{\\"bad\\":\\"$1\\",\\"good\\":\\"$2\\"}\\r\\nE1:{\\"message\\":\\"An error happened\\",\\"stack\\": \\"\\\\n...\\"}\\r\\nJ2:{\\"this\\":\\"worked\\"}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen this happens, the previously suspended part of the model now resolves and starts throwing an error on the client. This will then be caught by an error boundary on the client. Unrelated parts of the response can still continue rendering though.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the connection dies, then all remaining pending promises resolve and start throwing an error which are caught by error boundaries. Previously resolved parts don\'t error though.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere\'s a prioritization scheme so errors are emitted at lower priority in the stream than models.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Future Additions\\r\\n\\r\\nI added a comment describing the protocol. The protocol also includes space for a few other types of data.\\r\\n\\r\\n- _URL_: This can be used to emit URL rows at higher priority than models and can be used to preload other resources without waiting for or even parsing the JSON models yet.\\r\\n- _Blob_: Traditionally sending binary data is a PITA in existing protocol. We should just have this built-in. It\'s especially efficient with modern stream APIs. This is important in data heavy use cases like data viz.\\r\\n- _HTML_: Instead of encoding HTML inside JSON we can just send it as raw HTML for faster parsing and more efficient size. We can also encode that we generated this HTML (using React SSR with proper data structures) in the encoding. So we can by-pass dangerouslySetInnerHTML and just provide a React element that can be rendered directly.","created_at":"2019-11-06T06:17:46Z"},{"number":17284,"id":518203349,"title":"[Failing tests] startTransition invalidates downstream memoizations","user":{"login":"acdlite","id":3624098},"state":"open","body":"Like `dispatch` or `setState`, we should return the same `startTransition` function on every render. This prevents it from invalidating downstream memoizations, like `useCallback`.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe do use `useCallback` internally so that a new `startTransition` is only created when the config object changes. However, if you pass an object, this does nothing because the object different every time.\\r\\n\\r\\nPotential fixes:\\r\\n\\r\\n- Instead of detecting changes in the config object, compare the fields (`timeoutMs` et al) directly. This fixes the worst case (inline config object) but still means we\'ll occasionally re-create `startTransition` functions.\\r\\n- Track the current config object on an internal mutable field using an effect and read from that instead of binding a new method each time. This requires extra work in the commit phase, but combined with the previous option (comparing the fields instead of the entire config object) that should be rare.\\r\\n- Instead of passing the config object to the `useTransition` hook, pass it to the `startTransition` function. This avoids needing to bind the config object to the method. Slightly less ergonomic, however, we\'re planning to change the default config object so that it\'s not needed in most cases.

For example, a utility function that concatenates a string:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nexport greet(name) {\\r\\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nChanging the returned string to `Yo, ${name}!` would trigger this module to reload in the browser, but because components which depended on it don\'t reload, the old greeting will persist \\r\\nuntil the next render of each dependent component.\\r\\n\\r\\n(BTW in actuality, some tooling will reload immediate dependents of modules that are reloaded in order to get around similar problems. You can extend the dependency chain from two to three modules, where `a.js` depends on `b.js` depends on `c.js`, and you will get the same result when editing `c.js`)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat this forces tooling to do is apply a heuristic to try and guess whether a given module should be refreshed, vs. completely restart the app in order to cause all components to re-mount and pick up any changes that wouldn\'t be picked up by react-refresh.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problems with the heuristic approach is:\\r\\n- each dev tool needs to implement this logic, leading to more potential for bugs\\r\\n- it leads to a degradation of hot reloading capabilities based on what your module exports. not obvious at all on it\'s face and will lead people to twisting their code base to route around this\\r\\n- It\'s very unfriendly to compile-to-JS languages like ReasonML, ClojureScript, etc. which might have different default semantics for what is public / private, different conventions for naming components, etc. which make it difficult to detect whether a module is \\"safe\\" to refresh\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nThat components depended on newly loaded code will pick up those changes correctly, without losing state.\\r\\n\\r\\nA potential (maybe naive?) solution to this in react-refresh is, instead of only re-rendering the components marked as dirty (due to a different `type` being registered), to _re-render from the root_ while maintaining hooks state.

Since this is doing recursion it will cover `memo(C)`, `forwardRef(C)` , and `memo(forwardRef(C))`.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'m not quite sure if that\'s the best possible way to approach this problem since it\'s my first time contributing to the React codebase \ud83d\ude2c so I\'m not super familiar with it yet.

Everyone is in `performSyncWorkOnRoot` (none trigger the new code in `performConcurrentWorkOnRoot`). I spot checked a couple of them to see why the new code is being hit, to see if it looked problematic. Below is my findings:\\r\\n\\r\\n* `ReactES6Class-test` \\"_renders only once when setting state in componentWillMount_\\"\\r\\nThis one calls `performSyncWorkOnRoot()` twice. The first time is the callback passed from `legacyRenderSubtreeIntoContainer` to `unbatchedUpdates`. The second one (the one that bails out) is when `unbatchedUpdates` calls `flushSyncCallbackQueue`. This flush can be bailed out on.\\r\\n\\r\\n* `RaectDOMInput-test` \\"_should control a value in reentrant events_\\"\\r\\nThis one hits the new codepath when it dispatch a discrete \\"input\\" event. It looks like when our test calls `node.dispatchEvent()` for the \\"input\\" event, something is actually dispatching a series of events (input, input, blur, focus) which causes more updates to be scheduled with React than necessary. Now we bail out after the first.\\r\\n\\r\\n* `ReactCompositeComponent` \\"_should warn about `setState` in render_\\"\\r\\nThis one calls `setState` in render. Without this call, the bailout codepath doesn\'t get hit. Looks like the `setState` call leaves two things in the queue, so when the subsequent call to `flushSyncCallbackQueue` flushes them both, the second one is a no-op. The first thing gets added to the queue when the `setState` call is made. The second one by `commitRootImpl()` when it calls `ensureRootIsScheduled()` because `getNextRootExpirationTimeToWorkOn` returns a value that indicates there\'s more work.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n*

More generally, it supports generating different package.jsons depending on the build environment (release channel).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe package.json files that live at `packages/<package_name>/package.json` serve multiple purposes. The release scripts use them for guessing the next stable version numbers; they serve as templates for the actual package.jsons that get published to npm (the release script rewrites the version numbers first); during local development, the package source is symlinked into node_modules, which means the package.json is used for module resolution by Jest, Flow, Rollup, node scripts, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I would rather not fork the packages entirely like we do with other files (host config, feature flags, www-specific modules), because it could get confusing trying to keep the copies in sync.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a few different approaches we could use. One option is to generate the package.jsons in a post-install step, like we do with the Flow configs.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut since the immediate requirement is only to conditionally generate the package.jsons that are published to npm, another option is to generate those files during the build step. Everything else can use the existing package.json files that live in the source.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo it works like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n- If a package includes a `package.js`, the build script will use that instead of `package.json`.\\r\\n- `package.js` is a module that returns a JavaScript object of keys and values. The build script will serialize this to JSON and write it to the artifacts directory.\\r\\n- By convention, `package.js` files will import the `package.json` file from source and modify it before re-exporting.\\r\\n- If `package.js` does not exist for a module, the build script will use `package.json` directly.","created_at":"2019-10-29T23:54:03Z"},{"number":17215,"id":514302428,"title":"\\"DevTools v4 is incompatible with this version of React\\" with React Native & latest version of React","user":{"login":"kaitlynbrown","id":1388240},"state":"closed","body":"\x3c!--\\r\\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\\r\\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\\r\\n--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\nBug\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\nAfter starting react-devtools, I get the following error message:\\r\\n```\\r\\nDevTools v4 is incompatible with this version of React\\r\\nEither upgrade React or install React DevTools v3:\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.

This is an important guarantee for event emitter or subscription-like patterns where a single browser event can spawn updates on many different components, all of which need to commit consistently.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo do this, we have a heuristic of marking the first \\"event time\\" of an update inside an event.

This mostly works, since every update will eventually be followed by a render task. However, it has some flaws: if there\'s lots of other non-React main thread work in the mean time, subsequent events could get overbatched. The heuristic is also a bit fragile; it happens to be the case that every call to `requestCurrentTime` is accompanied by a render task, but that may not necessarily always be the case, creating a subtle refactor hazard.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead of relying on the next render task to reset the current event time, this change schedules a microtask.\\r\\n\\r\\nI didn\'t use an actual microtask because React does not currently require a Promise polyfill.

I\'ve previously been involved in the modernization of PHP\'s cryptography features ([removing mcrypt](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/mcrypt-viking-funeral), [adding libsodium](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/libsodium)), which in turn led to HHVM implementing their own sodium extension.\\r\\n\\r\\nConsequently, if you\'re using PHP 7.2 (or newer), or HHVM 3.20 (or newer), support for libsodium is [baked into the programming language](https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/bindings_for_other_languages) and you don\'t have to install anything extra. \\r\\n\\r\\n(Unless your operating system\'s packaging team is asleep at the wheel with PHP security. Let me know if you encounter that so I can hopefully help address these deficiencies in the ecosystem.)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs part of my security work, I\'ve been exposed to an increasing number of React apps in recent months. I like the philosophy of React (especially **learn once, write everywhere**).\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the time, the sheer fact that folks are developing in React instead of writing their own framework means I don\'t get to include client-side vulnerabilities (e.g. DOM-based XSS) in my reports. However, I *have* found a substantial number of cryptography-related issues in people\'s React apps. \\r\\n\\r\\nTo be clear: **That isn\'t React\'s fault at all.** It\'s a symptom of [the greater JavaScript ecosystem](https://twitter.com/CiPHPerCoder/status/1183282359862530049) and a general lack of easy-to-use, secure-by-default, and easily discovered cryptography libraries. (As the linked thread shows: AWS\'s libraries are almost certainly good, but at the time of that tweet, you wouldn\'t find them searching for \\"encryption\\" on NPM.)\\r\\n\\r\\nI would like to severely reduce the prevalence of trivial cryptography bugs in React projects. There are a couple of directions we can go with that goal in mind. I\'m going to propose one below, but by no means is my idea the *only* solution. \\r\\n\\r\\n(If so desired, I can separate this into two separate Github issues: One for the problem, the other for my proposed solution. Please let me know if that\'s easier to digest.)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Proposal \\r\\n\\r\\n### Background and Prior Development\\r\\n\\r\\n[The state of JavaScript cryptography is pretty terrible](https://dev.to/paragonie/sodium-plus-a-positive-cryptography-experience-for-javascript-developers-2p08). Writing performant code with libsodium requires manually sizing your own buffers, etc. Writing cross-platform code requires writing code a completely different way. \\r\\n\\r\\nNot using libsodium is [perilous in other ways](https://github.com/danang-id/simple-crypto-js/issues/12), and has motivated other security companies to recommend developers [just \\"use the NaCl/libsodium default\\"](https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html) in most places where cryptography touches application code.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the spirit of [scrypt-for-humans](https://github.com/joepie91/scrypt-for-humans), I developed a cross-platform, permissively licensed, asynchronous JavaScript module called [**Sodium-Plus**](https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the same spirit as React, we want users to be able to learn Sodium-Plus once, and write code anywhere. It runs in Node.js and in a web browser, with a near-identical API and user experience. (The delta in the UX is the unavoidable difference between loading a module with `require` and including a script tag in the HTML.)\\r\\n\\r\\n> You can [read the documentation online](https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus/tree/master/docs).\\r\\n\\r\\nBy default, Sodium-Plus uses [libsodium.js](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium.js), which is the result of libsodium compiled into WebAssembly, which runs in the browser. However, if you install sodium-native alongside sodium-plus, it will *opportunistically* use sodium-native instead with no code changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n(Sodium-native is much faster than libsodium.js, but isn\'t browser-compatible.)\\r\\n\\r\\n### The Meat and Potatoes of the Proposal\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven the challenges of the JavaScript ecosystem, and the availability of usable cryptography, I\'d like to recommend the inclusion of `sodium-plus` in a future release of React.\\r\\n\\r\\n* Users will have an identical user experience in a browser that they get in any Node.js environment (server, mobile, desktop, shell script, etc.).\\r\\n* A comparable API is already provided for HHVM users by Facebook.\\r\\n* PHP, which powers [roughly 4 out of 5 websites according to W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/programming_language/all), has already adopted a comparable API.\\r\\n\\r\\nReact doesn\'t currently provide a cryptography interface. If React ever does provide one, libsodium is almost certainly the best one to provide (prior to the maturity of post-quantum cryptography, of course). \\r\\n\\r\\nReact doesn\'t necessarily *have to* provide a cryptography interface, but React apps would be a lot safer if most developers had a stable, easy to use, misuse-resistant, cross-platform suite of cryptography tools at their disposal.\\r\\n\\r\\nOut of all the existing options for libsodium, ours is the only one that provides an async/await-ready API, works everywhere, and has the same API and developer experience where ever you encounter it (in the same spirit as React).\\r\\n\\r\\nI believe the arguments above make a strong case for sodium-plus as the best choice for the React community. If anyone has criticism to offer Sodium-Plus or my proposal in this Github issue, I welcome it.

However, they will be versioned using a separate scheme. Instead of semver versions, experimental releases will receive arbitrary version strings based on their content hashes. The motivation is to thwart attempts to use a version range to match against future experimental releases. The only way to install or depend on an experimental release is to refer to the specific version number.\\r\\n\\r\\nBuilding\\r\\n--------\\r\\n\\r\\nI did not use the existing feature flag infra to configure the experimental builds. The reason is because feature flags are designed to configure a single package. They\'re not designed to generate multiple forks of the same package; for each set of feature flags, you must create a separate package configuration.\\r\\n\\r\\nInstead, I\'ve added a new build dimension called the **release channel**. By default, builds use the **stable** channel. There\'s also an **experimental** release channel. We have the option to add more in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are now two dimensions per artifact: build type (production, development, or profiling), and release channel (stable or experimental). These are separate dimensions because they are combinatorial: there are stable and experimental production builds, stable and experimental development builds, and so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can add something to an experimental build by gating on `__EXPERIMENTAL__`, similar to how we use `__DEV__`. Anything inside these branches will be excluded from the stable builds. This gives us a low effort way to add experimental behavior in any package without setting up feature flags or configuring a new package.","created_at":"2019-10-11T23:55:42Z"},{"number":17070,"id":506037898,"title":"Make uncontrolled -> controlled warning clearer","user":{"login":"vcarl","id":1551487},"state":"open","body":"Fixes #17069.

Ideally in the special case where the component is memoized the message could definitively say the update was due to a context change, but I\'m not sure how to detect that situation \ud83d\ude42","created_at":"2019-10-11T15:11:14Z"},{"number":17067,"id":505861715,"title":"React hooks in HOC","user":{"login":"hacker-DOM","id":18601956},"state":"closed","body":"I have a pattern question.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'m thinking of using a pattern where I extract my logic in higher-order components, so components are actually \\"dumb\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSo instead of\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nconst Signup = props => {\\r\\n  const [onSubmit, {data}] = useMutation (SIGNUP_GQL)\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    ...\\r\\n  )\\r\\n}\\r\\nexport default Signup\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ll do\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nconst withMutation = gql => C => props => {\\r\\n   const [onSubmit, {data}] = useMutation (SIGNUP_GQL)\\r\\n   return <C onSubmit={onSubmit} data={data} />\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\nonce, and then just\\r\\n```js\\r\\nconst Signup = ({onSubmit, data}) => (\\r\\n  ...\\r\\n)\\r\\nexport default withMutation (SIGNUP_GQL) (Signup)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nSo far I haven\'t encountered any problems (up to many typo\'s \ud83d\ude09).

My naive understanding is that those two approaches should be *fundamentally* equivalent regardless of the implementation. But I want to make sure, and if they aren\'t, whether the developers plan to support HOCs going forward. I am structuring my whole project this way, so that\'s why this is important to me.

Working with Hooks should be a pleasure, but sometimes it\'s very hard work.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s start with the simplest example: `componentDidMount`. This most popular method in the component\'s lifecycle has no equivalent in Hooks! Of course, there is `useEffect` with which we can build similar \\"effect\\", but its syntax is NOT INTUITIVE.\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s look:\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\n// good old code\\r\\nclass App extends Component {\\r\\n  componentDidMount() { // very human name\\r\\n    console.log(\'mounted!\')\\r\\n  }\\r\\n  render() {\\r\\n    return <View />\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// new API\\r\\nconst App = () => {\\r\\n  useEffect(\\r\\n    () => {\\r\\n      console.log(\'mounted!\')\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    [] // ordinary human looks here and thinks: \\"square? wtf?\\"\\r\\n  )\\r\\n  return <View />\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nPersonally, for me, every empty array, or even unnecessary brackets, are just information noise. But `useDidMountEffect` can be written very easily...\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nconst useDidMountEffect = callback => useEffect(() => { callback() }, [])\\r\\n```\\r\\n...so, let\'s get to the second case: `componentWillUnmount`.\\r\\n\\r\\nReact documentation mentions that we can use `useEffect` to call a function when a component is unmounted:\\r\\n> Cleaning up an effect\\r\\n> The clean-up function runs before the component is removed from the UI...\\r\\nhttps://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect\\r\\n\\r\\nSo let\'s check it out:\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\n// again good old code for \\"contrast\\"\\r\\nclass App extends Component {\\r\\n  componentWillUnmount() { // yummie! this name is so sweet and readable...\\r\\n    console.log(\'unmounted!\')\\r\\n  }\\r\\n  render() {\\r\\n    return <View />\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// new API\\r\\nconst App = () => {\\r\\n  useEffect(\\r\\n    () => () => { // circle, arrow, circle, arrow, bracket and done: we can finally write our logic...\\r\\n      console.log(\'unmounted!\')\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    [] // Square again? React is special square friendly library or something?\\r\\n  )\\r\\n  return <View />\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBut as in the first example, here we can also write a custom hook:\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nconst useWillUnmountEffect = callback => useEffect(() => () => callback(), [])\\r\\n```\\r\\nEverything simple easy and fun? It seems so. **But not completely.** This custom hook forced me to write this issue, because the above code will not work at some specific moment. Probably most React Masters already guess when it won\'t work.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhere is the problem? Let\'s see:\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nconst App = () => {\\r\\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(\'nie\')\\r\\n  useEffect(\\r\\n    () => () => console.log(\'React Hooks: \', value),\\r\\n    []\\r\\n  )\\r\\n  return <TextInput value={value} onChangeText={setValue} />\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\nAnd now try to initiate the following actions on the above code:\\r\\n1. mount the component\\r\\n2. enter the value `works like charm!` to input\\r\\n3. unmount the component\\r\\n4. Check the console and find out the result is `React hooks: nie` instead `React hooks: works like charm!`\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat happened here? Of course, reference to the first value instead ACTUAL value...\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSo how can we fix this bug? Very easy xD\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\n// using hooks...\\r\\nconst App = () => {\\r\\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(\'\')\\r\\n  const actualValue = React.useRef(value)\\r\\n  useEffect(\\r\\n    () => {\\r\\n      actualValue.current = value\\r\\n    },\\r\\n    [value]\\r\\n  )\\r\\n  useEffect(\\r\\n    () => () => console.log(actualValue.current),\\r\\n    []\\r\\n  )\\r\\n  return <TextInput value={value} onChangeText={setValue} />\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// using classic React...\\r\\nclass App extends Component {\\r\\n  state = {\\r\\n    value: \'\'\\r\\n  }\\r\\n  setValue = value => this.setState({value})\\r\\n  componentWillUnmount() {\\r\\n    console.log(this.state.value)\\r\\n  }\\r\\n  render() {\\r\\n    return <TextInput value={this.state.value} onChangeText={this.setValue} />\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\nYep. This is how we were able to implement logging in the console of the last value of the given component.\\r\\n\\r\\n**And now the question: which version is more readable for a beginner? This with weird refs, arrows everwhere and squares, or with small and elegant class?**\\r\\nPersonally, I think programming should be easy. Or at least strive for simplicity. And the class implementation (old) is much easier to read and understand logic.\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nNew hooks:\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nconst App = () => {\\r\\n  React.useDidMountEffect(() => console.log(\'Mounted!\'))\\r\\n\\r\\n  React.useWillUnmountEffect(() => console.log(\'Unmounted!\'))\\r\\n\\r\\n  return <View />\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\nWithout any deps. In addition, `useWillUnmountEffect` get the ACTUAL context to use props or state in it.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd now defense. Someone can say: if you write your own custom hooks that behave the same as the proposed solution, why not just add them to your project and forget about the case? Well:\\r\\n* Currently, React contains a hook, which is a syntax sugar of another hook. Of course, we are talking about useState (which is an ordinary wrapper on useReducer). `useState` is also a hook that is a replacement for the `state` in class, so proposed hooks are analogy to `useState`.\\r\\n* Writing a reusable `useWillUnmountEffect` hook is very difficult (probably even impossible)\\r\\n* Programmers typically write the code as follows: `useEffect(callback, [])`, which causes each rerender to do shallow compare (`Object.is`) on dynamically created empty arrays. The proposed hooks will be more efficient.\\r\\n* An additional, readable function in the API reduces the information noise created in the application code.\\r\\n* Programming is supposed to be fun\\r\\n\\r\\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

I\'d like to have a lifecycle method similar to `componentDidCatch` which catches proptype errors. Every time when a proptype error is raised, I get a long and ugly warning which requires me to debug the app and find a component (sometimes there are hundreds-thousands of them) where the error appeared. Usually I have a complex tree of components and almost every component is a HOC over smaller components.

This would allow to more clearly see where the error appeared and to save time on debugging. Of course this should be available at dev environment only.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe use error boundaries powered by  `componentDidCatch` to catch **actual errors** and I imagine this new method as the tool to catch **potential errors**. There is no difference for me, both need to be fixed, so both need to be output similarly.

Components that shouldn\'t even be rendering, because their parents would exclude them, now do render and access data which doesn\'t exist in the state model any longer. Rendering isn\'t deterministic and hierarchical any longer.\\r\\n\\r\\nDan Abramov acknowledges this behaviour here: https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/959507572951797761\\r\\n\\r\\nThe current solution that Sebastian Markb\xe5ge suggested is to wrap dispatches into batchedUpdates.\\r\\n\\r\\nBut that doesn\'t work in mixed-mode React, where multiple reconcilers are active. So the same component will work in one reconciler, but crash in another, unless the dispatch is wrapped into each batchedUpdates from each reconciler - which puts the burden onto the consumer of the component and makes the component platform dependent.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis problem affects all flex based state managers. Redux for instance. Some fail outright, some do implement batchedUpdates (like Redux), but they will all fail in mixed-mode.\\r\\n\\r\\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/react-spring/zustand/issues/64\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nAs Dan Abramov himself said on Twitter, any dispatch should be async.

I will be able to best explain my idea by giving out an example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nconst SomeComponent = ({ props }) => {\\r\\n   const [state, setState] = useState(\'test\');\\r\\n   const someFn = useCallback(() => {\\r\\n       ...\\r\\n   }, [props.name]);\\r\\n   useEffect(() => {\\r\\n      someFn();  \\r\\n   }, [state]);\\r\\n\\r\\n   ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the code above, we are using hooks to essentially imitate class behaviors. Additionally, because the component is a function, we need to add things like `useCallback`; so that, the function does not get recreated. However, these things have been solved in classes for a very long time. Even React\'s class components solved these problems. What if this kind of API is added to React:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nclass SomeComponent extends React.NewComponent {\\r\\n    someFn = () => {\\r\\n        // use this.props here\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\n    state = new State(\'test\');\\r\\n    effect1 = new Effect(this.effectFn, [this.state]);\\r\\n\\r\\n    effectFn = () => {\\r\\n        const val = this.state.getValue();\\r\\n        someFn();\\r\\n        // or state.setValue(\'some other value\')\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\n    render() {\\r\\n        // you can use this.state.getValue() here\\r\\n        return (\\r\\n\\r\\n        );\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat problem does this solve? This eliminates the rule that all hooks have to be at the top of the function. This is because classes already have this behavior implemented. It is intuitive --- you can\'t use loop or conditions outside the class methods. Secondly, this eliminates hooks such as `useCallback` or `useRef` (for non DOM related things) because functions are not recreated during every render.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about dependencies in Effect? For dependencies, if a State instance is passed, the Effect hook will check if it is changed using different means (e.g State can have a \\"stale\\" member variable that gets updated from reconciler; then the effect uses that variable to check state. Or Effect can store the dependencies and do the normal checking using `state.getValue`).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat about custom hooks? React provides a \\"CustomHook\\" base class that developers can use. So, let\'s say I want to write a hook to fetch data:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nclass FetchHook extends React.CustomHook {\\r\\n    loading = new State(false);\\r\\n    data = new State([]);\\r\\n    error = new State(null);\\r\\n\\r\\n    effect = new Effect(this.effectFn);\\r\\n\\r\\n    effectFn = async () => {\\r\\n        try {\\r\\n            this.loading.setValue(true);\\r\\n            const response = await fetch(this.props.url); // i\'ll talk about this in a bit\\r\\n            const data = await response.json();       \\r\\n            this.loading.setValue(false);\\r\\n            this.data.setValue(data);\\r\\n        } catch (e) {\\r\\n            this.loading.setValue(false);\\r\\n            this.error.setValue(e);            \\r\\n        }\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\n    getLoading() {\\r\\n         return this.loading.getValue();\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\n    getData() {\\r\\n         return this.data.getValue();\\r\\n    }\\r\\n\\r\\n    getError() {\\r\\n         return this.error.getValue();\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, we can just add it to our components:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nclass SomeComponent extends React.NewComponent {\\r\\n    fetch = new FetchHook(someUrl);\\r\\n    render() {\\r\\n          const loading = this.fetch.getLoading();\\r\\n          const error = this.fetch.getError();\\r\\n          const data = this.fetch.getData();\\r\\n          // ...\\r\\n    }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nReact.Hook base class (React.CustomHook and React\'s own hooks are derived from it) has a function called `update` or `run` that initializes all the necessary things for the hooks. The reconciler can check whether the class field is an instance of React.Hook to do the necessary updates etc.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Why?**\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my opinion, combined with Hooks, React\'s composability is an implementation of [Entity-Component-System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system). Game Developers use this technique to set up entities (e.g a Tree or a Vehicle) in their game world. We are essentially using the same technique to set up entities (React Components) for UI. If we go on the comparison route, this is how I see it: Entity = React Component, Hooks = Components, System = React Reconciler + Renderer.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn general, ECS systems really shine when using classes. Writing components and assigning them to entities feels natural. We are using all the class features (class fields, methods, inheritance) to abstract away what is going on behind the scenes. However, with current state of using hooks with functions, React essentially created these class features in for functions. For example, a function is never recreated in a class. So, we need a `useCallback` to imitate the same behavior in function components. Same goes for `useRef` (excluding ref-ing to DOM) to imitate class member variables.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn terms of developer experience, using objects instead of functions have one major difference. At least for me, this is how it was when I was using class components. When using class member variables that are only defined (not called), it makes it simpler to think in React because I can assume that React calls these functions. If they are Hook objects (non-existent yet), I can assume that React calls their respective functions. In these two instances, React is doing the work on the components. However, when using hooks as functions, the flow is reversed: we are telling React what to do instead of letting React do what it wants based on our component logic. It almost looks like we are writing into React instead of just using React.

During hydration, the server rendered HTML isn\'t interactive. React records events to replay them once content becomes interactive- (but that doesn\'t actually happen until React finishes work on the nearest boundary and commits it). React may also reprioritize the order in which boundaries are processed (so that boundaries with pending events get processed sooner).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis general process can be hard to reason about and debug, because much of it is not observable visually (beyond some interactions potentially feeling more laggy than expected).\\r\\n\\r\\nDevTools already provides some visual overlays (e.g. which elements were rendered by the currently selected Component, [\\"highlight updates\\"](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16989)). Perhaps DevTools could help here too by visualizing which boundaries in the tree have been hydrated.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Visualizing hydration progress\\r\\n1. When React begins hydrating a new root<sup>1</sup> DevTools will show a visual overlay<sup>2</sup> that covers the entire DOM element container.\\r\\n1. As React hydrates and commits each new level of Suspense boundaries, DevTools will draw the overlay to only cover the not-yet-hydrated boundaries.\\r\\n1. Once hydration is completed, all overlays will be cleared<sup>3</sup>.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis feature would be opt-in via a new DevTools setting.\\r\\n\\r\\n<sup>1</sup> This suggests a new React-to-DevTools hook to inform DevTools when hydration starts.\\r\\n\\r\\n<sup>2</sup> This overlay would nee to be designed. Perhaps some combination of semi-transparent with stripes or bars so that it is high contrast enough to be seen.\\r\\n\\r\\n<sup>3</sup> Because the data required to draw these overlays is essentially just a timestamp and a set of rects, some form of replay might be a nice addition.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Special cases\\r\\nIt could be helpful to highlight a couple of special cases by temporarily showing a different style overlay:\\r\\n\\r\\n* **Client rendered content inside of a server rendered fallback.** ([This case.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/bb680a09052b5af6543daf28bfcc3283bbc35cf9/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L2030-L2039)) In some cases, the server rendered content may be a forced fallback that gets filled in with client rendered content.\\r\\n* **React can\'t complete hydration fast enough to process a client-side update.** ([This case.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/bb680a09052b5af6543daf28bfcc3283bbc35cf9/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L2064-L2074)) In this case, React ends up deleting the server-rendered content and replacing it with client rendered content. For example, a layout effect may set state on an ancestor that updates context. This update is synchronous (because it comes from within a layout effect) so it immediately expires.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\'t know if the above cases can be reliably detected by DevTools at present. They may require additional information (or an additional React-to-DevTools hook).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe following case does **not** need to be highlighted because it is not a deopt:\\r\\n* **Server rendered content removed before hydration.** In some cases, server rendered content is thrown away before hydration completes because of a user interaction. For example, if the user navigates to a new page before the initial page has finished hydrating.","created_at":"2019-10-02T22:01:29Z"},{"number":16992,"id":501748415,"title":"Hide Portals When they aren\'t wrapped in a host component when Parent Suspends","user":{"login":"lunaruan","id":2735514},"state":"closed","body":"Currently, when a node suspends, if its subtree contains a portal, the portal is not hidden.

For me it\'s perfectly valid to want to capture some variables in the closure, yet when those variables change we don\'t necessarily want to re-execute.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are many cases where people are using refs to \\"stabilize\\" some value that should not trigger re-execution, or to access fresh values in closures.\\r\\n\\r\\nExamples in major libs includes:\\r\\n- Formik (code is pretty similar to my \\"useSafeEffect\\" above): https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/blob/master/src/Formik.tsx#L975\\r\\n- React-redux, which uses refs to access fresh props: https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/b6b47995acfb8c1ff5d04a31c14aa75f112a47ab/src/components/connectAdvanced.js#L286\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso @Andarist (who maintains a few important React libs for a while): \\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65872332-9d8b9380-e380-11e9-90b3-bf294991bb82.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWe often find in such codebase the \\"useIsomorphicLayoutEffect\\" hook which permits to ensure that the ref is set the earliest, and try to avoid the useLayoutEffect warning (see https://gist.github.com/gaearon/e7d97cdf38a2907924ea12e4ebdf3c85). What we are doing here seems unrelated to layout and makes me a bit uncomfortable btw.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## Do we need an ESLint rule?\\r\\n\\r\\nThe ESLint rule looks to me only useful to avoid the stale closure problem. Without the stale closure problem (which the trick above solves), you can just focus on crafting the array/conditions for effect re-execution and don\'t need ESLint for that.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso this would make it easier to wrap useEffect in userland without the fear to exposing users to stale closure problem, because eslint plugin won\'t notice missing dependencies for custom hooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere\'s some code for react-navigation (alpha/v5). To me this is weird to have to ask the user to \\"useCallback\\" just to stabilize the closure of useFocusEffect, just to ensure the effect only runs on messageId change.\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65869719-3d462300-e37b-11e9-94d2-5200481588bc.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNot sure to understand why we can\'t simply use the following instead. For which I don\'t see the point of using any ESLint rule. I just want the effect to run on messageId change, this is explicit enough for me and there\'s no \\"trap\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65869777-564ed400-e37b-11e9-8570-12534e5f2a53.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ve heard that the [React team recommends rather the later](https://twitter.com/satya164/status/1178571088172896256), asking the user to useCallback, instead of building custom hooks taking a dependency array, why exactly? Also heard that the ESLint plugin now was able to detect missing deps in a custom hook, if you add the [hook name to ESLint conf](https://twitter.com/n1rual/status/1178568248062877701). Not, sure what to think we are supposed to do in the end.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Are we safe using workarounds?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s still a bit hard for me to be sure which kind of code is \\"safe\\" regarding React\'s upcoming features, particularly Concurrent Mode. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf I use the `useEffectSafe` above or something equivalent relying on refs, I am safe and future proof?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf this is safe, and makes my life easier, why do I have to build this abstraction myself? \\r\\n\\r\\nWouldn\'t it make sense to make this kind of pattern more \\"official\\" / documented?\\r\\n\\r\\nI keep adding this kind of code to every project I work with:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsx \\r\\nconst useGetter = <S>(value: S): (() => S) => {\\r\\n  const ref = useRef(value);\\r\\n  useIsomorphicLayoutEffect(() => {\\r\\n    ref.current = value;\\r\\n  });\\r\\n  return useCallback(() => ref.current, [ref]);\\r\\n};\\r\\n```\\r\\n(including important community projects like [react-navigation-hooks](https://github.com/react-navigation/hooks/blob/master/src/Hooks.ts#L46))\\r\\n\\r\\n## Is it a strategy to teach users?\\r\\n\\r\\nIs it a choice of the React team to not ship safer abstractions officially and make sure the users hit the closure problem early and get familiar with it? \\r\\n\\r\\nBecause anyway, even when using getters, we still can\'t prevent the user to capture some value. This has been documented by @sebmarkbage [here](https://gist.github.com/sebmarkbage/a5ef436427437a98408672108df01919) with async code, even with a getter, we can\'t prevent the user to do things like:\\r\\n\\r\\n```tsx\\r\\nonMount(async () => {\\r\\n  let isEligible = getIsEligible();\\r\\n  let data = await fetch(...);\\r\\n  // at this point, isEligible might has changed: we should rather use `getIsEligible()` again instead of storing a boolean in the closure (might depend on the usecase though, but maybe we can imagine isEligible => isMounted)\\r\\n  if (isEligible) {\\r\\n    doStuff(data);\\r\\n  }\\r\\n});\\r\\n```  \\r\\nAs far as I understand, this might be the case:\\r\\n\\r\\n> So you can easily get into the same situation even with a mutable source value. React just makes you always deal with it so that you don\'t get too far down the road before you have to refactor you code to deal with these cases anyway. I\'m really glad how well the React community has dealt with this since the release of hooks because it really sets us up to predictably deal with more complex scenario and for doing more things in the future.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## A concrete problem\\r\\n\\r\\nA react-navigation-hooks user reported that his effect run too much, using the following code:\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65870979-bf374b80-e37d-11e9-8a6c-1f7df8503c18.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nIn practice, this is because react-navigation core does not provide stable `navigate` function, and thus the hooks too. The core does not necessarily want to \\"stabilize\\" the navigate function and guarantee that contract in its API.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s not clear to me what should I do, between officially stabilizing the `navigate` function in the hooks project (relying on core, so core can still return distinct navigate functions), or if I should ask the user to stabilize the function himself in userland, leading to pain and boilerplate for many users trying to use the API.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\'t understand why you can\'t simply dissociate the closure dependencies to the effect\'s triggering, and simply omitting the `navigate` function here:\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65871264-51d7ea80-e37e-11e9-837d-291775853b2e.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat bothers me is that somehow as hooks lib authors we now have to think about whether what we return to the user is stable or not, ie safe to use in an effect dependency array without unwanted effect re-executions.\\r\\n\\r\\nReturning a stable value in v1 and unstable in v2 is a breaking change that might break users apps in nasty ways, and we have to document this too in our api doc, or ask the user to not trust us, and do the memoization work themselves, which is quite error prone and verbose. Now as lib authors we have to think not only about the inputs/outputs, but also about preserving identities or not (it\'s probably not a new problem, because we already need to in userland for optimisations anyway).\\r\\n\\r\\nAsking users to do this memoization themselves is error prone and verbose. And intuitively some people will maybe want to `useMemo` (just because of the naming) which actually can tricks them by not offering the same guarantees than `useCallback`.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n## A tradeoff between different usecases in the name of a consistent API?\\r\\n\\r\\n@satya164 also mentionned that there are also usecases where the [ESLint plugin saved him](https://twitter.com/satya164/status/1178395620236759043) more than once because he forgot some dependency, and for him, it\'s more easy to fix an effect re-executing too much than to find out about some cached value not updating. \\r\\n\\r\\nI see how the ESLint plugin is really handy for usecases such as building a stable object to optimize renders or provide a stable context value. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut for useEffect, when capturing functions, sometimes executing 2 functions with distinct identities actually lead to the same result. Having to add those functions to dependencies is quite annoying in such case. \\r\\n\\r\\nBut I totally understand we want to guarantee some kind of consistency across all hooks API.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nI try to understand some of the tradeoffs being made in the API. Not sure to understand yet the whole picture, and I\'m probably not alone. \\r\\n\\r\\n@gaearon said to open an issue with a comment: `It\'s more nuanced`. I\'m here to discuss all the nuances if possible :)\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat particularly bothers me currently is not necessarily the existing API. It\'s rather:\\r\\n- the dogmatism of absolutely wanting to conform the ESLint rules (for which I don\'t agree with for all usecases). Currently I think users are really afraid to not follow the rules.\\r\\n- the lack of official patterns on how we are supposed to handle some specific hooks cases. And I think the \\"getter\\" pattern should be a thing that every hooks users know about and learn very early. Eventually adding such pattern in core would make it even more visible. Currently it\'s more lib authors and tech leads that all find out about this pattern in userland with small implementation variations.\\r\\n\\r\\nThose are the solutions that I think of. As I said I may miss something important and may change my opinions according to the answers.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an author of a few React libs, I feel a bit frustrated to not be 100% sure what kind of API contract I should offer to my lib\'s users. I\'m also not sure about the hooks patterns I can recommend or not. I plan to open-source something soon but don\'t even know if that\'s a good idea, and if it goes in the direction the React team want to go with hooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n","created_at":"2019-09-30T11:07:44Z"},{"number":16955,"id":500116330,"title":"When SSR returns a field that is inconsistent with the client side, the client side should prevail","user":{"login":"leiyourong","id":17899723},"state":"closed","body":"There is the demo:\\r\\n\\r\\nreturn page(HTML) is: \\r\\n```\\r\\n<html>\\r\\n <head>\\r\\n    ...\\r\\n </head>\\r\\n  <body>\\r\\n    <div id=\'react\'>\\r\\n      <div id=\\"level1\\">\\r\\n        <div id=\\"level21\\">22</div>\\r\\n      </div>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n  </body>\\r\\n</html>\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd the root Component is:\\r\\n```\\r\\nclass App extends React.Component {\\r\\n  render () {\\r\\n    return (\\r\\n      <div id=\\"level1\\">\\r\\n        <div id=\\"level211\\">221</div>\\r\\n        <div className=\\"level33\\">33</div>\\r\\n      </div>\\r\\n    )\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\nhydrate(\\r\\n  <App />,\\r\\n  document.getElementById(\'react\')\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally the page dom will be rendered as:\\r\\n```\\r\\n<body>\\r\\n    <div id=\\"react\\">\\r\\n           <div id=\\"level1\\">\\r\\n                <div id=\\"level21\\">221</div>\\r\\n                <div class=\\"level33\\">33</div>\\r\\n          </div>\\r\\n   </div>\\r\\n</body>\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems that the id of the first child of div#level1 is incorrect.\\r\\n\\r\\nReact & ReactDom version: 16.8.6","created_at":"2019-09-30T08:02:34Z"},{"number":16954,"id":499977709,"title":"Why will Suspense for data fetching require a cache?","user":{"login":"ghengeveld","id":321738},"state":"open","body":"I\'m [integrating Suspense with React Async](https://github.com/async-library/react-async/pull/153), and I\'ve been reading up on how it\'s supposed to work.

See this thread: https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1178018850937290753?s=21\\r\\n\\r\\nUltimately, it is harder for shops that do micro frontends to ensure everyone is compliant with new React versions. It is also easier to catch things early at build time then to dig around in the browser runtime when there may be other compounding issues.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe other benefit of this would be that it would enable third party libraries to potentially have \u201cday 1 support\u201d for new major React versions because they could follow the rule set and ensure that they are forwards compatible without being caught trying to do it all at once.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, I\u2019m happy to help drive/contribute to any rule set to make sure it works in our use case.\\r\\n","created_at":"2019-09-28T19:44:12Z"},{"number":16947,"id":499812767,"title":"onclick event is not attached to a div under ternary operators when doing a map function","user":{"login":"TomYang1993","id":20257736},"state":"closed","body":"**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\n\\r\\nmaybe a bug or design in purpose?\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nonclick event is not attached to a div under ternary operators when doing a map function,\\r\\nonclick doesn\'t have response to clicks\\r\\n\\r\\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.

Happy to refactor if you tell me an alternative way to present the backend server which would be preferred to an express dependency.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe app is a \'row editor\' which edits rows from a backend, having an id and title. The UI offers a list of row links. The user can navigate to edit a row from the list or create a new row. The front end user is expected to edit the title field. However, the backend also needs to make changes(it adds the id value from the \'database\' when a new record is saved).\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are two lines which require an override otherwise the app enters a loop between client and server, creating runaway saves and reloads and making the UI unusable.

Additionally, the interlocking concerns of e.g. navigating to rows, auto-saving rows, creating new rows contribute to defining the problem. With fewer features supported, the problem doesn\'t arise. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe [backend code](https://github.com/cefn/graphql-gist/blob/c0bece7e6b1fda832d57ccb363b1056f7cb2d37b/react-event-loop/backend.js) is super-simple so hopefully doesn\'t confuse.

Refs attached to components created via these methods provide a set of functions such as\\r\\n```\\r\\n.measure\\r\\n.measureInWindow\\r\\n.measureLayout\\r\\n.setNativeProps\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThese methods have been used for our core components in the repo to provide a consistent API. Many of the APIs in React Native require a `reactTag` to a host component. This is acquired by calling `findNodeHandle` with any component. `findNodeHandle` works with the first two approaches.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor a lot of our new Fabric APIs, we will require passing a ref to a HostComponent directly instead of relying on `findNodeHandle` to tunnel through the component tree as that behavior isn\'t safe with React concurrent mode.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal of this change is to enable us to differentiate between components created with `requireNativeComponent` and the other types. This will be needed to be able to safely type the new APIs.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor existing components that should support being a host component but need to use some JS behavior in a wrapper, they should use `forwardRef`. The majority of React Native\'s core components were migrated to use `forwardRef` last year. Components that can\'t use forwardRef will need to have a method like `getNativeRef()` to get access to the underlying host component ref.\\r\\n\\r\\nNote, we will need follow up changes as well as changes to the React Renderer in the React repo to fully utilize this new type.\\r\\n","created_at":"2019-09-25T22:24:42Z"},{"number":16897,"id":498509313,"title":"DevTools shows unsupported renderer version dialog","user":{"login":"bvaughn","id":29597},"state":"closed","body":"Rather than partially supporting v14, DevTools now shows an unsupported dialog with a link to instructions on how to downgrade DevTools to v3:\\r\\n\\r\\n![Screen Shot 2019-09-25 at 1 27 17 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/29597/65637372-ec0feb00-df98-11e9-8d79-223815f3e6d0.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nI decided on this approach to detecting versions by looking at all v14 and v15 minor releases and by referencing [the old DevTools logic](https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools/blob/d839081f79f681617df7584a8ffd2f4163fa40b9/backend/attachRenderer.js#L24-L76).\\r\\n\\r\\nI tested all minor release of v15 and v16 to ensure that the dialog didn\'t get shown.

React Hooks must be called in the exact same order in every component render.`\\r\\n\\r\\n**Reports**\\r\\nI guess that it is already known issue because, inside the [ESLintRulesOfHooks.js - L562](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/__tests__/ESLintRulesOfHooks-test.js#L562), it is already known that in some cases caching of cyclic paths in code path, might result in the wrong errors.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso (#16832) reports this case too.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Reason**\\r\\nEslint uses `CodePathSegment` which is similar to doubly linked list. Based on the `CodePathSegment` AST different types of cyclic segments might happen. In the special case of [ForInStatement](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/code-path-analysis#forinstatement) there are two paths from obj identifier to the next segment. In such a graph, in order to traverse all the paths from start to end, we need to not only remember the current segment, but also the whole path. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe current code uses a simple caching just by name of segments (and not the list of segment history) as a result, whenever it faces a cycle, it breaks the cycle by returning 0. As a result, there might be several conditions, where the segment might have cyclic and not cyclic paths to end. In the current code, if the first path is cyclic all the non-cyclic ones are thrown away. And depending on the starting point and endpoint of AST, we might have different results.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example for the demo code, the result of  [RulesOfHooks.js - L404](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/src/RulesOfHooks.js#L291), the value of all `allPathsFromStartToEnd` is calculated as `2` instead of `3`\\r\\n\\r\\n**Solution**\\r\\nWe need caching of responses and also saving cyclic paths for later logic, In the new code, I added a different caching mechanism, which also remembers the path history too. The effect of the performance is still negligible because even for [the most difficult test](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/eslint-plugin-react-hooks/__tests__/ESLintRulesOfHooks-test.js#L293) including `1099511627776` paths from start to end of the code, it only increases the time about 0.3s on MacBookPro.","created_at":"2019-09-22T18:23:33Z"},{"number":16852,"id":496806233,"title":"Suspense + useEffect?","user":{"login":"javierguzman","id":906599},"state":"closed","body":"Hello all,\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst time around here so thank you very much for all your great work and providing this technology to the rest :)\\r\\n\\r\\nI want to report a bug even though maybe is the expected behaviour.

Today, we don\'t allow for the new event system to supply methods on the event object to do `preventDefault` and `stopPropagation`. The reasoning for this was based a few important points:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Events are used in hooks, and hooks aren\'t meant to be able to affect if another event hook triggers or doesn\'t.\\r\\n2. We want to be able to determine during server-side render what events should be prevented and propagated when it comes to replaying the events during client-side hydration.\\r\\n3. For RN, the idea is that we can tell the native side this information declaratively ahead of time.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Propagation\\r\\n\\r\\nWe already have a form of `stopPropagation` in the current event system. The `Keyboard` responder, which has a way of basically doing `stopPropagation` (the return value can allow for propagation). Given that we\'ve not run into that many issues with keyboard, this kind of already means that point 1 above was probably not needed. The hooks themselves still work, it\'s just their callbacks that are affected, and that doesn\'t actually invalidate the Rules of Hooks after-all.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Preventing native behaviour\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a very important use-cases for where we want to be able to conditionally `preventDefault` at runtime \u2013 when handling user focus management.  In the cases where we want to \\"control\\" where focus goes using keyboard input, we `preventDefault` on the key that is being pressed so native focus doesn\'t fire. However, what if we don\'t want to control the focus? There\'s no way to conditionally switch of preventing the native event part way through a key press. I also noticed that we end up having all these complex abstractions to try and work around the fact that we have these constraints in place, often ending up generating far more code in the process.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What about event replaying?\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be ideal to know ahead of time if something gets prevent defaulted or not, but it feels like we\'re building all this complex architecture just to handle a bunch of event replaying cases. Keyboard input probably shouldn\'t even be replayed, and that\'s one of the main cases where you need conditional propagation and preventing of default behaviour. Pointer events should probably always prevent default, or at least always be declaratively known \u2013 so at least they make sense when replaying. Things like scroll should ideally never be prevented, as it leads to a terrible UX.\\r\\n\\r\\n## What about RN?\\r\\n\\r\\nHandling of keyboard on RN is another tricky case. I\'m not sure of the best way forward here. It gets even more complex because it would be nice in an ideal world for this problem space to be handled in part with Fabric, where we can yield to JS without causing as much of an issue as there is today without Fabric.","created_at":"2019-09-18T15:11:59Z"},{"number":16821,"id":495227101,"title":"[React Native] Fix for view config registrations","user":{"login":"rickhanlonii","id":2440089},"state":"closed","body":"## Overview\\r\\nThis change fixes a behavior in the React Native view config registry which would hide errors when registering components.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Details\\r\\nBefore this change, even if we failed to register the view config for any reason (e.g. the events are invalid), we would still clear the callback for the view config.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis means, the next time that a user renders the component and we check for the view config, we would show this error:\\r\\n\\r\\n> View config not found for name Slider\\r\\n\\r\\nThis error is wrong.

So using functional `setState` wouldn\'t be right for me, as it would force me to update state, right?

As opposed to TT support potentially \\"turning on\\" later in the app. This does mean, however, that TT needs to be initialized before ReactDOM to be acknowledged.\\r\\n* I\'ve revamped the tests so that they actually verify that we pass the TT objects to the DOM sinks. I\'ve checked that replacing every `toStringOrTrustedType` call with `\'\' + value` now fails a particular test so we\'re covering them all.\\r\\n* I\'ve restructured `setInnerHTML` a bit to remove the duplicate `innerHTML` assignment which is easy to accidentally mess up.

Conceptually, most of them should be treated as errors. They indicate bugs. For example, not fixing a \\"key\\" warning can result in very bad issues in production. For these \\"warnings\\", the only difference from a real error is that they don\'t throw and the checks are removed in production. Because they\'re expensive to do.\\r\\n\\r\\nReact warnings ultimately become `console.error` calls. In the source, they are expressed as `warning(cond, message, ...args)`. If the `cond` is false, the warning gets printed.\\r\\n\\r\\nBy default, calling `warning` will print a `console.error` with the current component stack appended at the end. Sometimes, we may not want the component stack. Maybe the warning is aggregated from many components (e.g. a StrictMode violation), and the stack is not relevant. In that case we have `warningWithoutStack`. It has the same API as `warning`, but doesn\'t append the stack. In fact, `warning(format, ...args)` is internally implemented as `warningWithoutStack(format + \'%s\', ...args, stack)`.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also have a lesser-known `lowPriorityWarning` module. Unlike `warning` which uses `console.error`, `lowPriorityWarning` uses `console.warn`. It is \\"lower severity\\" (appears yellow in console), and we currently use it only for deprecation messages.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Problems\\r\\n\\r\\n* The naming is confusing. `warning`s are conceptually errors, and use `console.error`, but their name doesn\'t reflect that.\\r\\n* The `warning(cond, ...)` API is confusing. It is easy to forget whether `cond` is supposed to be `true` or `false` for the warning to fire. (Answer: it fires on `false`.) Due to this confusion, a bunch of callsites just do `if (!cond) warning(false, ...)` to avoid thinking about this.\\r\\n* `warning` and `lowPriorityWarning` have different default behavior. `warning` appends component stack by default, but `lowPriorityWarning` doesn\'t. This makes it difficult to \\"downgrade\\" a `warning` to `lowPriorityWarning` because we\'d lose the stack and have to manually append it.\\r\\n* Some `warning`s don\'t actually represent \\"errors\\" in practice. They have too high severity. It\'s not a huge deal in the console. But if you start hooking up the console to richer mechanisms (e.g. an error dialog), the difference becomes more annoying. You want to clearly separate *what\'s broken today* from *what may break tomorrow*.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Ideal End State\\r\\n\\r\\n* All React warnings are audited and split into two severities: `error` (stuff that is likely broken today) and `warn` (stuff that may break in the future).\\r\\n  - This means we\'ll likely \\"downgrade\\" some mostly advisory warnings.\\r\\n* React codebase just calls `console.error` for severe warnings (potential bugs), and `console.warn` for mild warnings (e.g. deprecations).\\r\\n  - A build step may wrap them in `__DEV__ ` blocks, append the component stack, and otherwise tweak the implementation.\\r\\n\\r\\n## How Do We Get There?\\r\\n\\r\\n### <s>Step 1. lowPriorityWarning() Parity</s>\\r\\n\\r\\n* Rename `lowPriorityWarning` to `lowPriorityWarningWithoutStack`.\\r\\n* Add `lowPriorityWarning` which appends the stack (but don\'t add usages of it).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal here is just to make it easy to switch between `warning` <-> `lowPriorityWarning` or `warningWithoutStack` <-> `lowPriorityWarningWithoutStack` whenever we want.\\r\\n\\r\\nEnsure `toWarnDev` and `toLowPriorityWarnDev` matchers are equivalent too and both support `withoutStack` named argument.\\r\\n\\r\\nNotice there\'s `lowPriorityWarning.www.js` fork. It should be renamed to `lowPriorityWarningWithoutStack.www.js`, but it should keep reqiure-ing `lowPriorityWarning` inside (because it refers to an external module).\\r\\n\\r\\n### <s>Step 1.5. Replace Babel plugin with an ESLint plugin</s>\\r\\n\\r\\nSee https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17081#issuecomment-541908417.\\r\\n\\r\\n### <s>Step 2. Remove the condition argument</s>\\r\\n\\r\\nWrite a codemod to convert all `warning(cond, format, ...args)` (and its `lowPriority*` or `*WithoutStack` variations) to `if (!cond) { warning(format, ...args) }`. If `cond` is already `false`, just omit the condition. You could do this manually but it seems error-prone. So I recommend a codemod.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou\'ll notice there are some \\"forks\\" of `warning`, like `warningWithoutStack.www.js` or `lowPriorityWarning.www.js`. You\'ll want to modify them to reflect the new API \u2014 but keep in mind that external files they reference still have the old API. So they need to \\"translate\\" it.\\r\\n\\r\\nDon\'t forget there are Babel plugins and build scripts that deal with `warning`. They probably make assumptions about its argument order that you will need to consider. Make sure we don\'t emit invalid code or accidentally stop transforming them.\\r\\n\\r\\n<s>### Step 3. Renames</s>\\r\\n\\r\\nMy proposal:\\r\\n\\r\\n* `warning` => `consoleError`\\r\\n* `warningWithoutStack` => `consoleErrorNoStack`\\r\\n* `lowPriorityWarning` => `consoleWarn`\\r\\n* `lowPriorityWarningWithoutStack` => `consoleWarnNoStack`\\r\\n* `toWarnDev` => `toConsoleErrorDev`\\r\\n* `toLowPriorityWarnDev` => `toConsoleWarnDev`\\r\\n* `{withoutStack}` => `{noStack}`\\r\\n\\r\\nMake sure all build transforms, the warning extraction script, and the forks continue working.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Step 4. Warning Audit\\r\\n\\r\\nSplit `consoleError` calls into two groups:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Actual likely bugs today (e.g. missing key, or an UNSAFE method in concurrent mode)\\r\\n* Possible future issues that don\'t cause bugs today (e.g. UNSAFE method in strict mode, or setState in unmounted component)\\r\\n\\r\\nDowngrade the second group to `consoleWarn` calls.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Follow-ups\\r\\n\\r\\nAt this point we\'ll be pretty close to direct `console.error` calls. I don\'t know if we want to actually start doing that in the source, and have transform catch that. If we do, we\'d need to find a way to express \\"no stack\\" in some other way (or even always append them).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf we stick with `consoleError` imports, we might want to add a lint rule that prevents adding direct `console.error` calls except a few places where it\'s intentional. So that we don\'t mix them up.\\r\\n\\r\\n### How to Split Work\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is gonna touch a lot of files. Expect merge conflicts etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nI suggest splitting it like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Step 1 as a PR. We can land this fast.\\r\\n* Step 2 + Step 3 can be done as changes to build scripts + a codemod. It should be easy to re-run just the codemod. This is one PR.\\r\\n* Then Step 4 after previous PR lands.\\r\\n\\r\\n**I need to emphasize again that @Jessidhia is taking this so please don\'t send PRs.**","created_at":"2019-09-11T15:27:54Z"},{"number":16752,"id":492305336,"title":"Moved backend injection to the content script","user":{"login":"onionymous","id":19634607},"state":"closed","body":"Moved the backend injection logic to the content script.

Including the initial argument source code is a special case for `useState` and `useReducer` since that usually signals an intentional attempt to remount.\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, it\'s not always safe to emit an arbitrary string in some environments. For example, in www we have a transform that replaces `cx(\\"foo\\")` with some string hash *regardless of whether it\'s inside a string or not*. It\'s just a regex. So if an expression like this becomes a part of a signature, www transforms can produce a syntax error.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo fix this, we can default to always emitting hashes for signatures.

The trigger *seems to be* a call to print() that results in a React state change somewhere (which, in Chrome, seems to happen because the print preview it shows can cause media query events, which can be hooked up to calls to a setState function).  This does not always happen, however--as shown in the example if the code is not called from in a setTimeout it doesn\'t seem to crash.  In addition, if the user initiates printing instead (e.g. via CTRL+P), React never crashes.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe two errors I\'ve seen happen as a result of this are `Failed to execute \'handleEvent\' on \'EventListener\': The provided callback is no longer runnable` (needs \\"Pause on caught exceptions\\" in Chrome\'s DevTools to catch), and after a few of those they\'re followed by `Maximum update depth exceeded` (even though the setState function is only called once).

E.g. it can take a while before the user calls `root.render()`. In batched mode, there\'s a gap before the scheduled callback actually starts rendering. In concurrent mode, there\'s a gap every time we yield. Additionally, for Suspense boundaries, we use Partial Hydration and there\'s a gap between rendering each new level.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn between these gaps, there can be events issued on dehydrated DOM nodes that are currently dropped. This adds the basic infra for replaying those events.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt is not behind a feature flag or any mode because it should not be possible to get into this mode in the legacy `ReactDOM.hydrate(...)` API since it doesn\'t leave any gaps. So if there is a reason this has any behavior changes, that\'s a bug and we\'d like to find it.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Principle\\r\\n\\r\\nThe constraint here is that we can\'t wait for the actual components to load/render before showing the server rendered HTML. We also can\'t load much in terms of even the event system. We\'re limited to as much script we can reasonably inline into the HTML page which isn\'t much.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome interactions don\'t make sense to do any other way than handling once we do have the code. Such a click on a rich UI. These needs to be prioritized.\\r\\n\\r\\nOther interactions can\'t be replayed later. They have to be dealt with by the browser right now. Such as text input.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany small interactions such as hovering or scrolling a bit also is fairly harmless.\\r\\n\\r\\nSome events are not really user driven and can be inferred by a hydrating component (such as image \\"load\\").\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are cases where the dehydrated tree needs to be dropped and we can no longer replay that event. Such as if it gets deleted by a previous event or forced client-rendered. We could use this mechanism to force hydration even synchronously such as before invoking a discrete event. However, the issue with doing that is that there are so many discrete events that happen just by navigating around such as keypresses or touch to scroll. This would also not work before the code has loaded so we\'d have to always wait to show the SSR content until the code has loaded. This wouldn\'t work with the plain HTML option.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy hypothesis here is that we can get far by letting the browser do most of what it does by default. Server rendered components would know to be somewhat resilient to this. Then we simply replay those events as \\"passive\\" events later to let JS observed what happened. This inherently is a somewhat degrated experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Event Types\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ve categorized events as \\"discrete\\", \\"continuous\\" or \\"other\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"discrete\\" category are similar to Discrete priority events. It\'s events that needs to be replayed in the order they were issued and each one needs to be replayed.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"continuous\\" category are things like mouseover, focus, selectionchange. It\'s expected that there are a lot of these while the user is simply navigating the page. However, the previous ones are not really relevant and can be collapsed. Only the last state for each type needs to be replayed. There\'s only one \\"hover target\\" and one \\"active element\\" once we hydrate. The intermediate steps are not relevant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe \\"other\\" category don\'t need to be replayed. Either because it can be replayed by the Host component hydrating itself or it\'s not a critical event.\\r\\n\\r\\n## In this PR:\\r\\n\\r\\n- [x] Replay continuous events.\\r\\n- [x] Listen to all replayable events eagerly when we call createRoot.\\r\\n- [x] Tests\\r\\n\\r\\n## Follow up PRs:\\r\\n\\r\\n- [ ] Avoid attaching active listeners eagerly in Flare.\\r\\n- [ ] Expose callback when an event doesn\'t get a target during replay. I.e. it\'s \\"dropped\\".\\r\\n- [ ] Don\'t replay events if `beforeunload` fires. This means a link or form successfully navigated. This avoids double side-effects by the browser navigation and JS both triggering.\\r\\n- [ ] Allow grandfathered events to be passed to `ReactDOM.createRoot(..., {replayEvents: ...})`. This allows an early light script to track events that happened before even React loaded onto the page.\\r\\n- [x] Increase priority of suspense boundaries that are blocked on for discrete updates to User Blocking priority. (All boundaries or just the first event?) This gives us \\"selective hydration\\".\\r\\n   - [x] We have an option to also attempt at sync priority which could allow `preventDefault` behavior *if* that succeeds. This is useful for handling links with JS.\\r\\n- [x] Increase priority of suspense boundaries that are blocked on for continuous updates to Low priority.\\r\\n- [x] Add API such as `ReactDOM.hydrate(node)` to increase the priority of that boundary to Normal pri or whatever scheduler priority context we\'re running in.\\r\\n- [ ] Timeout boundary if it takes too long to hydrate.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn future PRs we can improve the actual replaying mechanism based on special cases. I\'m sure there\'s a long tail.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn particular the integration with Flare has some flaws right now. We can also evaluate having Flare replaying happen at other levels such as in the synthetic layer.","created_at":"2019-09-10T07:17:39Z"},{"number":16724,"id":491482659,"title":"is it a bug about updata?","user":{"login":"zhangenming","id":21235555},"state":"closed","body":"\x3c!--\\r\\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\\r\\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\\r\\n--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\nbug\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\nnot same with twice case,\\r\\n\\r\\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.

A simple true / false would suffice. This would be useful to have for a very specific issue I\'m facing with using `recharts`. It has a super nice declarative JSX approach but based on the way it\'s designed, it has some limitations. Some child components (XAxis for instance) are tightly coupled with their parent component (BarChart, etc). Long story short, creating proper HOCs on them is basically impossible due to defaultProps interference. I\'m creating a wrapper for the top level component (BarChart) that provides additional default props to its child components (theme context, etc). I have the following code:\\r\\n```typescript\\r\\nconst BarChart: React.FC<BarChartProps> = fixWrapperFC(BarChartBase, (props) => {\\r\\n\\tconst { children, ...rest } = props;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tconst theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext);\\r\\n\\r\\n\\treturn (\\r\\n\\t\\t<BarChartBase {...rest}>\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t{React.Children.map(children, (c: any) => {\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif (!c || !c.type || !c.type.displayName) {\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treturn c;\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconst displayName = c.type.displayName;\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tif (displayName === \\"XAxis\\") {\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\treturn React.cloneElement(c, { ...xAxisProps({ theme, ...c.props }), });\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t}\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treturn c;\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t})}\\r\\n\\t\\t</BarChartBase>\\r\\n\\t);\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\nThe problem is that `c.props` already has default props, and the only way to accomplish what I\'m doing is to subtract off default props with some type of equality algorithm, but my first thought is that it\'s ugly (the code I pasted above is ugly too, but the exterior would be nice and clean).\\r\\n\\r\\nI suppose the real problem is the limitations on how this library is designed and that it probably indulges anti-patterns to achieve it\'s declarative style. The real solution would likely be to rewrite it to support HOCs, however, I\'d imagine at some point in the react code, `Object.keys(passedInProps)` and/or `Object.keys(defaultProps)` is somewhat cheaply available and could be tacked onto the child object?\\r\\n\\r\\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

This looks like a standard context use-case so far.

The core of the issue is `React.forwardRef` passing `null` as `ref` argument to the wrapped component if the parent component doesn\'t pass a ref. `undefined` would be better in this case, but there might be a reason to pass `null` that I\'m not aware of, so I\'m not comfortable calling this a bug.\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven:\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nexport default React.forwardRef((props, ref) => <MyComponent innerRef={ref} {...props} />);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n`MyComponent` will receive `null` as `ref` argument when a parent component doesn\'t pass a ref. Leaving aside that `undefined` better represent the fact that something was not passed than `null`, this also makes it impossible to use the forwarded ref internally in `MyComponent` because it will be `null` and we cannot reassign the prop.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ve been able to work around this using the following solution (excuse my classyness please, shouldn\'t matter much for the example):\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nclass MyComponent extends React.Component {\\r\\n\\tel = React.createRef();\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tcomponentDidMount() {\\r\\n\\t\\tif (!this.el.current) {\\r\\n\\t\\t\\tthis.el = this.props.innerRef;\\r\\n\\t\\t}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\tif (!this.el.current) return;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t// bind event handlers to this.el\\r\\n\\t}\\r\\n\\r\\n\\trender() {\\r\\n\\t\\tconst childRef = this.props.innerRef || this.el;\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\treturn <button ref={childRef}>Look at my button</button>;\\r\\n\\t}\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the above works, it\'s not the nicest piece of code and there\'s code in two places in order to support adapting to the case when parent doesn\'t pass a ref.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nNot only is `undefined` a less surprising value for `ref` argument when no ref is passed by the parent, but I think it would also allow us to use `defaultProps` to make a new ref the default when nothing is passed in.

It does this by increasing the priority of the hydration task from Idle to a level slightly higher than the current render. React will abort the current render, perform the hydration, then try the update again on top of the now-fully-hydrated content.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are unit tests that cover this case. The bug starts happening when `disableSchedulerTimeoutBasedOnReactExpirationTime` is enabled. It turns out that the mechanism to interrupt the current rendering task depends on the hydration task having a slightly earlier timeout, because Scheduler tasks are sorted by their timeouts. When the hydration task is higher priority, it causes `shouldYield` to flip to true, forcing the render to yield execution and allowing the hydration task to start. (This is similar to how input events can interrupt normal priority renders.)\\r\\n\\r\\n`disableSchedulerTimeoutBasedOnReactExpirationTime` breaks this mechanism, because when it is enabled, the timeout given to Scheduler is no longer based on React\'s internal expiration times. Effectively, all rendering tasks within the same priority category are first-in-first-out. So, the hydration task comes *after* the original task in the Scheduler queue, and therefore `shouldYield` will keep returning `false`, and the original task will run to completion. (See https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16284 for more information on `disableSchedulerTimeoutBasedOnReactExpirationTime`.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe first commit in this PR adds a regression test for this case.\\r\\n\\r\\n## The Fix\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are several potential fixes. The one I\'ve chosen is not ideal in the long term, but it\'s lower risk compared to the complete solution, which will likely require some refactoring of how rendering tasks are scheduled.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe work loop already has some logic to cancel a rendering task in favor of a higher priority one, using `Scheduler.cancelCallback`. It does this by comparing the React expiration times of each task, so it doesn\'t depend on the ordering of tasks in Scheduler. This works when the high priority task is received during an input event.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, `Scheduler.cancelCallback` is currently a no-op when given an already-running task. It does not cause the task to stop execution, and if the task does yield with a continuation, then the continuation will run. Which means it won\'t work if React is already inside the render phase. (Note the distinction between \\"inside the render phase\\" versus \\"in an event that fires in between two chunks of a time sliced task.\\")\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fix in the second commit addresses both parts: canceling the current task causes `shouldYield` to return `true`, and if the canceled task returns a continuation, the continuation is ignored.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is sufficient to fix the regression.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Alternative Fixes\\r\\n\\r\\nA proper fix would be to model interruptions of in-progress renders in such a way that it does not depend on Scheduler\'s semantics for canceling and yielding. However, because of the inherent risk involved in changing how rendering tasks are scheduled, I would prefer to land this smaller fix first before attempting a refactor.\\r\\n\\r\\n(There\'s already a planned mini-refactor of the work loop, e.g. to optimize how pings and restarts are modeled. We can fold this into that larger change.)","created_at":"2019-08-30T00:30:20Z"},{"number":16613,"id":487211617,"title":"Adopt Contributor Covenant","user":{"login":"zpao","id":8445},"state":"closed","body":"In order to foster healthy open source communities, we\'re adopting the\\r\\n[Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).

While looking through the source I found that the `Work` returned from `createRoot` has a parameter called `onCommit`. For me this implied it\'s called after the commit [which doesn\'t seem to be intended](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/0ca28b526496b4c9cc523e222beffeda73af7172/packages/react-dom/src/__tests__/ReactDOMRoot-test.js#L58). However given the code below I get `Uncaught Invariant Violation: work.commit(): Cannot commit while already rendering. This likely means you attempted to commit from inside a lifecycle method.`\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nfunction App() {\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <div className=\\"App\\">\\r\\n      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>\\r\\n      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById(\\"root\\");\\r\\nconst root = ReactDOM.unstable_createRoot(rootElement);\\r\\n\\r\\nroot.render(<App />).then(() => {\\r\\n  const batch = root.createBatch();\\r\\n\\r\\n  batch.render(<App />);\\r\\n  // bad\\r\\n  batch.commit();\\r\\n  setTimeout(() => {\\r\\n    // good\\r\\n    //batch.commit()\\r\\n  }, 0);\\r\\n  batch.then(() => {\\r\\n    // good\\r\\n    //batch.commit();\\r\\n  });\\r\\n});\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThree things I noticed:\\r\\n1. seems like I need to call batch.commit after the batch is complete. Changing it to \\r\\n```\\r\\nbatch.then(() => {\\r\\n  // good\\r\\n  batch.commit();\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\ngot rid of the error. But I noticed that the original code is used throughout the internal tests. In fact moving createBatch and batch.commit the batch well after (long timeout) the initial root.render call seemed to allow sync `batch.render; batch.commit`.\\r\\n\\r\\n2. \\"lifecycle\\" should be replaced with something different before these APIs get stable since we try to get away from this mental model. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor example [`applies setState in componentDidMount synchronously in a batch`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4d307de458dfdf25e704cb2ca20b0578bba8998c/packages/react-dom/src/__tests__/ReactDOMRoot-test.js#L143) could be converted to a sync test and still pass while I would\'ve expected [`can defer a commit by batching it`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/4d307de458dfdf25e704cb2ca20b0578bba8998c/packages/react-dom/src/__tests__/ReactDOMRoot-test.js#L132) to fail with the invariant violation from above.\\r\\n\\r\\n3.

In the existing semantics there exist no replaying, instead things are ignored (see #16532). So this PR makes sure we don\'t dispatch these events to React\'s event system. They may still have been invoked on non-React nodes.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever the tricky part is that we don\'t readily know if a node is a non-React DOM node or if it\'s just a node we haven\'t gotten to yet.

We let the effects re-run, even if deps are `[]`, and free the memo\'d values.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is important because it prevents us from referencing stale code. For example, if we edit top-level `computeExpensive`, we still want `useMemo(() => computeExpensive(), [])` to re-evaluate.\\r\\n\\r\\nSometimes this may cause problems, but arguably this points to other flaws in components or Hooks that should be fixed regardless.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is a failure case though. Generally, while components shouldn\u2019t *rely* on `useMemo` for semantics, there is still an expectation that memo chains can \u201csettle\u201d. For example, `useSubscription` does a render-phase update if its arguments differ from its state:\\r\\n\\r\\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/0da7bd0604a5be7f96572b9f75d16fef5674bc5d/packages/use-subscription/src/useSubscription.js#L42-L45\\r\\n\\r\\nIt has to rely on something like `useMemo` in the calling code to keep the source *eventually stable*.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with our current approach is that during a Fresh update, dependencies are ignored completely. So even with `useMemo`, things never truly \u201csettle\u201d. This breaks the pattern relied upon by `useSubscription`, and likely, other similar mechanisms.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fix is to **only ignore dependencies during the first render after the patch**. By that point it has run, all memo\'d values have been recreated with fresh code. So it makes sense that we can turn off the cache busting flag for all subsequent render-phase updates of this component, thus letting it settle. This fixes the infinite loop in the regression test I\'ve added.","created_at":"2019-08-26T20:23:26Z"},{"number":16573,"id":485401156,"title":"[react-hooks/exhaustive-deps] missed warning when passing a function","user":{"login":"whatisaphone","id":772985},"state":"open","body":"\x3c!--\\r\\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\\r\\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\\r\\n--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\n\\r\\nArguably a **bug** in eslint-plugin-react-hooks\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nThe exhaustive-deps rule does not catch the following case:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nconst FooContext = React.createContext(() => {});\\r\\n\\r\\n// Meanwhile, somewhere deep in the component tree\\r\\nfunction Bar() {\\r\\n  const foo = useContext(FooContext);\\r\\n  useEffect(foo, []);\\r\\n  return <div>A div walks into a Bar\u2026</div>;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nI think the plugin should suggest adding the dependency on `foo`:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nuseEffect(foo, [foo]);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIt already makes this suggestion for the verbose form of the code:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// This code:\\r\\nuseEffect(() => foo(), []);\\r\\n// is fixed to:\\r\\nuseEffect(() => foo(), [foo]);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

I need to monkey-patch it myself now in order to be able to automatically add some accessibility related attributes (which in my case are needed in the majority of DOM elements, could be added automatically, so adding them manually and teaching every dev on the project to add them is too much of a hustle). Some might suggest using custom jsxFactory in the project\'s config, which is a semi-option, it requires to import that custom `createElement` in all 100500 tsx files of the project and educate all the devs about it.

Colloquially, DOM API becomes strongly typed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, with Trusted Types Element.innerHTML property setter accepts a TrustedHTML object.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrusted Type objects stringify to their inner value. This API shape is a deliberate choice that enables existing web applications and libraries to gradually migrate from strings to Trusted Types without breaking functionality. In our example, it makes it possible to write the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nconst policy = TrustedTypes.createPolicy(\'foo\', { \\r\\n  createHTML: (s) => { /* some validation*/; return s} \\r\\n});\\r\\n\\r\\nconst trustedHTML = policy.createHTML(\'bar\');\\r\\nanElement.innerHTML = trustedHTML\\r\\n\\r\\nanElement.innerHTML === \'bar\'\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above code works regardless if the Trusted Types enforcement is enabled or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nReading from the DOM is unaffected, so Element.innerHTML getter returns a string. That\'s for practical reasons -- web applications read from DOM more often than they write to it, and only writing exposes the application to DOM XSS risks. Typing only the setters allows us to secure web applications with minimal code changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Adding Trusted Types to React for server side\\r\\nUnfortunately, there are no Trusted Types (TT) on server side. However, it\u2019s really easy to introduce a reflected xss attack via server side rendering. Markup rendered on server side is rendered to string (without any DOM emulation) and returned as a response from the server and there is no way TT can prevent this attack. This creates inconsistency when rendering on client and server side (client side would fail with TT violation), which shouldn\u2019t happen. Also, if application uses hot reloading, you will get a TT error after each reload (because React templates are re-rendered to DOM, this time on client).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR enables applications to use Trusted Types on server side. Functions inside [ReactDOMNodeStreamRenderer.js](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc807720780962729df2ad1b0f53258603c020c7/packages/react-dom/src/server/ReactDOMStringRenderer.js) and [ReactDOMStringRenderer.js](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/fc807720780962729df2ad1b0f53258603c020c7/packages/react-dom/src/server/ReactDOMNodeStreamRenderer.js) in react-dom/server package now accept optional third parameter with [trusted types polyfill implementation](https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types). If TT are provided, they are enforced, **otherwise no behavioral change is made**. If TT are enforced, we check whether the values are trusted before creating the markup from them and throw an error otherwise.   \\r\\n\\r\\n## Reference\\r\\n* [Add trusted types to react on client side](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16157)\\r\\n","created_at":"2019-08-23T14:01:19Z"},{"number":16554,"id":484540050,"title":"Input type=\\"number\\" fields don\'t call onChange","user":{"login":"CluEleSsUK","id":3749956},"state":"closed","body":"\x3c!--\\r\\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\\r\\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\\r\\n--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\nbug\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\n`<input type=\\"number\\">` fields do not call onChange, and ignore their controlled value if text is entered into them.

In that case it seems dodgy that depending on the order in which you cancel callbacks, it would either work or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nOr is this optimization purely an optimization? Are the test asserting on implementation details too aggressive? Why does the \\"Main Thread\\" bar never stop? Or are we missing a \\"suspended\\" event that should have happened in that case?\\r\\n\\r\\nFinally, the logic to determine whether we \\"suspended\\" or \\"resumed\\" seems fragile to me. I don\'t know for sure what those terms are supposed to mean. For example, if a callback errors, did we \\"suspend\\"? It seems like no from the code, but I don\'t know why. Conceptually, I\'d think of an \\"error\\" as \\"suspending\\" the scheduler loop. Unless \\"suspend\\" means something else here.\\r\\n\\r\\nMy last commit just removes the \\"optimization\\" (9a6440440ef9b0100579d70abfb1c51592922bfb). **It breaks some tests but I can\'t move further without understanding their intent.** Is it the code, the assertions, or the test setup that needs to change?\\r\\n\\r\\nWas this more than an optimization? I\'ll leave it at that so someone else can pick it up. :-)\\r\\n\\r\\n</details>\\r\\n\\r\\nI chatted to Boone, and arrived at a solution that satisfies both of us. Basically, I wasn\'t sure what Suspended and Resumed events mean. Boone told me it\'s okay to treat them as \\"exit the loop\\" and \\"enter the loop\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nSo in the next commits I did the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Removed the `pop()` optimization that affected non-profiling paths to reduce the risk. (9a6440440ef9b0100579d70abfb1c51592922bfb)\\r\\n  - This broke tests because they seemed to assert on implementation details\\r\\n* Strengthened tests to explicitly treat Suspend and Resumed as \\"exit\\" and \\"enter\\", and added assertions for that (8482f5de03f1621d6025bc0cf87da3d565c2f979)\\r\\n  - This further broke tests because we didn\'t always emit these events in pairs\\r\\n- Finally, made Suspended and Resumed match 1:1 to \\"exiting\\" and \\"entering\\" the flush (1f5f7df068a52aeb180797aa21dea1aef0329781)\\r\\n  - I had to amend tests to match this new behavior.

behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nI apologize this might seem convoluted, but there are several things involved that make this problem:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. I have a typical Context provider that stored it\'s state values using `useReducer`\\r\\n2. In a leaf component where I\'m consuming that context, I have an effect that does some async code and then sets state in the context (setState function passed down through context)\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nfunction ShoppingPage() {\\r\\n  const { shoppingCartState } = useContext(Context);\\r\\n  useEffect(() => {\\r\\n    getShoppingCartStuff().then(shoppingCartState.setCart);\\r\\n  }, []);\\r\\n  // I later added [shoppingCartState.setCart] to the dep array. See comments below\\r\\n\\r\\n  return <div>Cart: {shoppingCartState.cart}</div>;\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Recently I added the \\"exhaustive-deps\\" lint rules and caught that I wasn\'t adding `shoppingCartState.setCart` to that dep array. So I added it and started getting an infinite loop. My thought process was `shoppingCartState` must be getting a new identity in memory. \\r\\n4. After exploring for a while, I decided to change the state of the context to use `useState` and the infinite loop went away.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo just to be clear, the state in context being managed with `useState` or `useReducer` doesn\'t cause an infinite loop until I add that dep array value for `shoppingCartState.setCart`, then `useReducer` causes a loop and `useState` doesn\'t\\r\\n\\r\\nExample with both `useState` and `useReducer` versions\\r\\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/competent-boyd-yzzyh\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nHopefully no loop\\r\\n\\r\\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

This request is certainly understandable, but it presents a couple of challenges:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Identifying which hooks values change would requires shallowly re-rendering each function component.\\r\\n2. Identifying a hook in a non-ambiguous way requires displaying the full hooks tree structure (since hooks aren\'t named).\\r\\n\\r\\nLet\'s take each of a look at each of these below.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 1 - Identifying which hooks values change\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the challenge for DevTools when it comes to hooks is identifying custom hooks. Sebastian\'s [proposed solution](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-devtools-experimental/blob/master/src/backend/ReactDebugHooks.js) is that DevTools temporarily overrides React\'s hooks dispatcher while it shallowly re-renders the component. During the re-render, each time one of the built-in hooks is used, our override implementation parses the stack to identify \\"custom hooks\\" (functions higher up in the callstack that begin with \\"use\\"). After render is completed, we reassemble this information into a tree structure which DevTools can display.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently we only do this  shallow render when a component is [inspected](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-devtools-experimental/blob/master/OVERVIEW.md#inspecting-an-element), but in order for us to track which hooks have changed while profiling, we would need to shallowly render _every_ component using hooks during the profiling session. Mostly likely we would have to do this during the performance sensitive \\"commit\\" phase since that\'s when DevTools is notified of an update.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think we could do better than re-running the above hooks override for every component on every commit if we:\\r\\n* Created a map of Fiber to cached hooks tree structure.\\r\\n* Lazily populate the above map (by shallow re-rendering) only when a component was updated for the first time.\\r\\n* Compared Fiber `memoizedState`s to identify changes on future commits and map them back to the tree structure based on their position in the list structure. <sup>1</sup>\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, even with the above optimizations this would still add significant overhead to a performance sensitive phase.\\r\\n\\r\\n<sup>1</sup> I think this should work but might also end up being complicated to implement.\\r\\n\\r\\n## 2 - Identifying a hook\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough the variables that hooks values are assigned to are meaningfully named, the hooks themselves are unnamed. Because of this, DevTools has no feasible way of identifying a hook short of displaying the entire hooks tree structure. Consider the following example code:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nfunction useCustomHook(...) {\\r\\n  const [foo, setFoo] = useState(...);\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction ExampleComponent(props) {\\r\\n  const [bar, setBar] = useState(...);\\r\\n  const [baz, setBaz] = useState(...);\\r\\n  const custom = useCustomHook(...);\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe example above shows 4 hooks: three `useState` and one custom. Let\'s say that \\"foo\\" and \\"baz\\" changed in a particular render. How would DevTools identify this? It could just show \\"two state hooks\\" but that\'s not very helpful. I think the only way we could identify it would be to show the entire tree, and visually highlight which hooks in it have changed:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nState\\r\\nState *\\r\\nCustomHook\\r\\n  State *\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is _okay_ but it\'s not great unless the developer is cross-referencing the component (and probably the custom hooks definition as well). To help with this, we could also _show the values_ but now we\'re adding more overhead in terms of trackin and bridge traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\n## In summary\\r\\n\\r\\nClearly both of these challenges can be overcome but they are non-trivial to implement and they will certainly add more runtime overhead to the profiler.

Consider the following example:\\r\\n```js\\r\\nfunction useSomeCustomHook() {\\r\\n  const [foo, setFoo] = useState(true);\\r\\n  const [bar, setBar] = useState(false);\\r\\n\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction Example() {\\r\\n  const baz = useSomeCustomHook();\\r\\n\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently in DevTools the above component would be displayed as follows:\\r\\n```\\r\\nSomeCustomHook:\\r\\n  State: true\\r\\n  State: false\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis information isn\'t as rich as we would prefer. \u2639\ufe0f\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next question is often: \\"can you use the name of the variable the hook return value is assigned to?\\" but this is tricky because DevTools doesn\'t actually have any way to access that variable. (Even if DevTools has a handle on the `Example` function above, how would it access the `useSomeCustomHook` function?)\\r\\n\\r\\n## The proposal\\r\\n\\r\\nThe solution to this would be some form of user-defined metadata (preferably generated by a code transform). Building on the precedent of the `useDebugValue` hook (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/14559), we might introduce a new no-op hook e.g. `useDebugName`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above example could make use of this hook like so:\\r\\n```js\\r\\nfunction useSomeCustomHook() {\\r\\n  const [foo, setFoo] = useState(true);\\r\\n  useDebugName(\\"foo\\"); // injected by Babel transform\\r\\n  const [bar, setBar] = useState(false);\\r\\n  useDebugName(\\"bar\\"); // injected by Babel transform\\r\\n\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction Example() {\\r\\n  const baz = useSomeCustomHook();\\r\\n\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nDevTools could then display something like:\\r\\n```\\r\\nSomeCustomHook:\\r\\n  State (foo): true\\r\\n  State (bar): true\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## Implementation details\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new `useDebugName` hook might be a noop hook provided by React (similar to `useDebugValue`) _or_ it could even be an export from the (soon to be released [`react-debug-hooks` package](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-debug-tools/)). The key concerns would be that:\\r\\n1. It has no effect (and adds no overhead) when DevTools is not present.\\r\\n2. Not calling it at all (or only calling it for _some_ hooks) should not break or corrupt anything.\\r\\n\\r\\nDevTools could override the no-op `useDebugName` implementation before inspecting a component and automatically associate the provided name with the most recently called native hook.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, the following code should only result in one named hook (the second `useState` call).\\r\\n```js\\r\\nconst [foo, setFoo] = useState(true);\\r\\nconst [bar, setBar] = useState(false);\\r\\nuseDebugName(\\"bar\\"); // injected by Babel transform\\r\\nconst [baz, setBaz] = useState(true);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBeing able to support sparse name metadata would be important for third party code (that might not be transformed to supply the metadata).\\r\\n\\r\\nA code transform would be ideal for this scenario because manual annotation would probably be cumbersome. This could also be marketed as a **DEV-only transform** so as not to bloat production bundles with display names. We might even try to detect the env and throw if it isn\'t DEV (like https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15939).\\r\\n\\r\\n## Further considerations\\r\\n\\r\\n### Custom hooks?\\r\\n\\r\\nIn some cases, custom hooks might also be ambiguous. Consider the `useSubscription` hook (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15022):\\r\\n```js\\r\\nfunction Example() {\\r\\n  const foo = useSubscription(...);\\r\\n  const bar = useSubscription(...);\\r\\n\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently in DevTools the above component would be displayed as follows:\\r\\n```\\r\\nSubscription: \\"some value\\"\\r\\n  State: Object\\r\\nSubscription: \\"some other  value\\"\\r\\n  State: Object\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nMaybe the value alone (provided by `useDebugValue`) could be enough to uniquely identify the hook, but I suspect in many cases it might not be sufficient. Should we then use `useDebugName` for custom hooks as well?\\r\\n\\r\\nI think it would be more fragile given the way our custom hooks detection logic is implemented. Custom hooks are not identified until after a component has finished rendering. In order for us to associate names with custom hooks, we would need to maintain a stack of names. This could lead to potential mismatches though in the event that `useDebugName` was called more (or fewer) times than there are custom hooks.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, consider the following code:\\r\\n```js\\r\\nfunction useSomeCustomHook() {\\r\\n  const [foo, setFoo] = useState(true);\\r\\n  useDebugName(\\"foo\\");\\r\\n  useDebugName(\\"effectively ignored\\");\\r\\n  const [bar, setBar] = useState(false);\\r\\n  const [baz, setBaz] = useState(false);\\r\\n  useDebugName(\\"baz\\");\\r\\n\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n````\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proposed implementation of `useDebugName` would be robust enough to handle naming \\"foo\\" and \\"baz\\" states and leaving \\"bar\\" as anonymous state hook. If we were maintaining a stack of names however, this discrepency would be more difficult to manage.\\r\\n\\r\\nPerhaps there is a clever solution to this problem. I would probably suggest leaving it out of the initial implementation though and only revisiting if we determine it\'s a necessary feature.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Alternatives considered\\r\\n\\r\\n### Pass debug name as an additional (unused) parameter\\r\\n\\r\\nAn alternative approach to calling a separate hook for naming purposes would be to pass the display name as an additional parameter to the native hook, e.g.:\\r\\n```js\\r\\nfunction useSomeCustomHook() {\\r\\n  const [foo, setFoo] = useState(true, \\"foo\\");\\r\\n  const [bar, setBar] = useState(false, \\"bar\\");\\r\\n\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction Example() {\\r\\n  const baz = useSomeCustomHook();\\r\\n\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pros**:\\r\\n* Less code.\\r\\n* Does not introduce a new hook.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Cons**:\\r\\n* It requires knowledge about the arity of native hooks. Ror example `useReducer` has optional parameters that the transform (or manual code) would need to be aware of to avoid a runtime error.\\r\\n* It would not be possible to support naming custom hooks (if that\'s something we decided to do).\\r\\n\\r\\n### Load source code (with source maps) and parse for name\\r\\nWe could use an extension API like [`Resource.getContent`](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/devtools_inspectedWindow#method-Resource-getContent) to load the source code (including custom hooks) and parse it determine the hook/variable names. Essentially this would work like the proposed transform above, but at runtime.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pros**:\\r\\n* Does not require a Babel transform step. (\\"Just works\\")\\r\\n* Does not potentially bloat production builds (if transform is used incorrectly).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Cons**:\\r\\n* Adds additional async loading (complexity) to suspense cache used for hooks inspection.\\r\\n* May have difficulty parsing certain code patterns (e.g. Babel\'s destructuring transform) unless we embed a full parser.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Call `toString` on the function component and parse for name\\r\\nA possible 80/20 variant of the above proposal would be to simply call` toString` on the function component and parse any top-level hooks.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pros**:\\r\\n* Does not require a Babel transform step. (\\"Just works\\")\\r\\n* Does not potentially bloat production builds (if transform is used incorrectly).\\r\\n* Does not require any additional asynchronous code.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Cons**:\\r\\n* Only supports top-level hooks (used directly within the function).\\r\\n* May have difficulty parsing certain code patterns (e.g. Babel\'s destructuring transform) unless we embed a fullp parser.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Use a Babel transform to leave an inline comment (and call `toString` to search for it)\\r\\nRather than inserting a call to a new custom hook, our code transform could just insert an inline comment with the name. We could then parse the code to find the inline comment, e.g.:\\r\\n```js\\r\\nfunction Example() {\\r\\n  /* hook:foo:Example.react.js:3 */\\r\\n  const foo = useSubscription(...);\\r\\n  /* hook:bar:Example.react.js:5 */\\r\\n  const bar = useSubscription(...);\\r\\n\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n**Pros**:\\r\\n* Does not potentially bloat production builds (if transform is used incorrectly).\\r\\n* Potentially sidesteps difficulty of parsing certain code patterns (e.g. Babel\'s destructuring transform).\\r\\n\\r\\n**Cons**:\\r\\n* Only supports top-level hooks (used directly within the function).\\r\\n* Still requires an explicit transform step.\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\nOriginally reported via https://github.com/bvaughn/react-devtools-experimental/issues/323","created_at":"2019-08-19T21:50:31Z"},{"number":16473,"id":482544795,"title":"DevTools: Switch between \\"Rendered At\\" renders using keyboard arrow keys","user":{"login":"bvaughn","id":29597},"state":"open","body":"My favorite devtools feature, \\"Why did this render?\\", has a remaining problem: it\'s too hard to flip through a long list of renders in the Rendered At list to find an interesting render.

We didn\'t know how Hooks would be received by the community. Taking the whole `use*` prefix seemed dicey and we didn\'t want to push the convention harder than absolutely necessary.\\r\\n2. It is a runtime crash anyway, so you find out about this immediately.\\r\\n3. There\'s a `history` library whose 2.x versions had an API like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nconst {createHistory, useBasename} = require(\'history-2.1.2\');\\r\\nconst browserHistory = useBasename(createHistory)({\\r\\n  basename: \'/\',\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nSo banning this pattern would create a false positive for it.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Why ban it now?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf your environment uses \\"inline requires\\" (opt-in on React Native), you might not get a crash at all. Instead, **the top level initialization of a module may run as a result of some component\'s render**, and so Hooks would accidentally \\"belong\\" to the parent. That\'s confusing. While \\"inline requires\\" aren\'t very common on the web, they\'re a powerful optimization, so it\'s plausible they will get used more often with time as build systems add support for them.\\r\\n\\r\\nEven regardless of that risk, we can confidently say Hooks have been a successful rollout now. So whether the bugs themselves are a problem or not, **the `use` convention effectively already strongly implies it\'s a Hook**. From that perspective, `use*()` at top level is just confusing to look at.\\r\\n\\r\\n### But I\'m not using a Hook!\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are some older versions of `history` and `react-router` that had `use`-prefixed APIs for things that aren\'t Hooks. **If you see a false positive, please feel free to suppress it:**\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// eslint-disable-next-line react-hooks/rules-of-hooks\\r\\nconst browserHistory = useBasename(createHistory)({\\r\\n  basename: \'/foo\'\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is not ideal, but this isn\'t an issue in recent versions of these libraries \u2014 and also most apps only have at most a single file with this issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you for some reason can\'t add suppressions, you may alternatively:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Rename it during import like `import { useBasename as withBasename } from \'history\'`\\r\\n* Or use `import * as History from \'history\'` and `History.useBasename()`\\r\\n\\r\\nNote this isn\'t just to \\"appease the linter\\". People expect `use` prefix to only be used by Hooks now, so it\'s good to push the ecosystem towards consistent naming.\\r\\n\\r\\n### What about `MyLibrary.useFoo()`?\\r\\n\\r\\nWe warn about invalid use of `use*()` and `React.use*()`, but not `MyLibrary.use*()`. This is because initially we saw too many false positives from modules like `MyStore.useNewAnalytics()`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe new top-level error respects the same rule. For example, it would warn for `useBasename()`, but not for `History.useBasename()`. So that\'s another escape hatch if you want to suppress it.\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\n// Doesn\'t warn\\r\\nconst browserHistory = History.useBasename(History.createHistory)({\\r\\n  basename: \'/foo\'\\r\\n});\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIn the future, we might consider making it stricter, and banning invalid calls to `MyLibrary.use*()` too. But it\'s less common in general because the convention is to import Hooks directly without a namespace. It\'s also much more commonly encountered in open source, like `app.use()` from Express, or `jest.useFakeTimers()`. So maybe it\'s not worth it.","created_at":"2019-08-19T14:54:18Z"},{"number":16454,"id":482252191,"title":"npm ERR! code ELIFECYCLE","user":{"login":"anujsinghwd","id":24680004},"state":"closed","body":"- Already tried with `npm cache clean`\\r\\n- Removing `node_modules`\\r\\n- try again installing `npm i`\\r\\n\\r\\n![Screenshot from 2019-08-19 16-43-12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24680004/63261418-10452180-c2a1-11e9-9d4f-fc9585d9097a.png)\\r\\n","created_at":"2019-08-19T11:17:57Z"},{"number":16453,"id":482242488,"title":"Don\'t trigger fallbacks in act()","user":{"login":"threepointone","id":18808},"state":"open","body":"We have some code that triggers suspense fallbacks when in an act() scope.

The context API allows us to avoid doing this if we create, import and maintain our own context object wherever we need it.\\r\\n\\r\\nInside a functional component using the latest context API with hooks, this may look something like:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport React, { useContext } from \'react\';\\r\\nimport myContext from \'../myContext\';\\r\\n\\r\\n const MyComp = (props) => { \\r\\n  const context = useContext(myContext);\\r\\n\\r\\n  return(\\r\\n    <div>\\r\\n      ...\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n   );\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n([source](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55848811/2253888)). If I\'m not mistaken, the legacy context API exposed `context` as a second argument to functional components. For all intents and purposes, context is an opt-in feature (meaning there is no default/out-the-box `context` object exposed). \\r\\n\\r\\nI feel as though there would be good benefit in exposing a default context object which exposes information about ancestral components (essentially exposing the parent tree). After all, such information would qualify for the regular definition of \\"context\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider the below JSX:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nconst Alpha = (props) = (\\r\\n  <Beta fizz=\'buzz\'>\\r\\n    <Gamma isActive>\\r\\n      <Delta />\\r\\n    </Gamma>\\r\\n    <Gamma>\\r\\n      <Delta />\\r\\n    </Gamma>\\r\\n  </Beta>\\r\\n);\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nConsider the `<Delta>` component - we want access to the parent `isActive` prop on the `Gamma` component and the `fizz` prop on the `Beta` component. The typical recommendation is to explicitly pass props to components that need the values. In the above case, it would be more convenient to access them implicitly.\\r\\n\\r\\nA scenario where I were able to do this would be wonderful:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nconst Delta = (props, context) => {\\r\\n  console.log(context.Beta.fizz); // => \'buzz\'\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <div style={context.Gamma.isActive ? \'block\' : \'none\'}>\\r\\n      Lorem ipsum\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n  )\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, essentially exposing parent props. Currently if I want similar behaviour I need to [create wrapper components](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/lifting-props-up-f1be43a1d7a4) (or I have to explicitly create, export and import various context objects).\\r\\n\\r\\nDoes anyone else feel as though something like this would be useful? Or does it offer too much potential for abuse? For \\"context\\", this would probably mostly help with things like styling, where it\'s often more convenient to work in this manner.

This modifies the existing [`@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx`](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx/src/index.js) (and [helper](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-helper-builder-react-jsx/src/index.js)) babel plugin to support `React.jsx` and `React.jsxDEV`. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe main differences between `React.jsx`/`React.jsxDEV` and `React.createElement` are:\\r\\n  1.) `key` is now passed as an explicit argument rather than through props\\r\\n  3.) `children` are now passed through props rather than as an explicit argument\\r\\n  4.) `props` must always be an object\\r\\n  5.) `__source` and and `__self` are now passed as separate arguments into `React.jsxDEV` rather than through props\\r\\n\\r\\nPart of the rationale for this change is that we want to deprecate key spread through props because this is an expensive dynamic comparison operation. We want users instead always explicitly pass key as a prop. However, in the interim, we need a way to distinguish between `<div {...props} key={foo} />` and `<div key={foo} {...props} />`. Therefore, until we completely deprecate key spreading, we will use `React.createElement` to transform `<div {...props} key=\\"Hi\\" />` and `React.jsx` to transform everything else.","created_at":"2019-08-16T20:41:25Z"},{"number":16431,"id":481769358,"title":"New React Developer Tools does not clearly indicate empty object or array","user":{"login":"taniarascia","id":11951801},"state":"closed","body":"**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\n\\r\\nBug/unexpected behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen an object or array is empty, there\'s no arrow to expand and see that it\'s empty, nor is there an `(empty)` indication.

Act doesn\'t return a promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nCurrently the `act` function returns an object with a `then` method that doesn\'t return a promise.\\r\\n\\r\\nRecently, I tried to write something like:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nact(() => {\\r\\n  return doSomethingAsynchronous()\\r\\n})\\r\\n.then(() => {\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n})\\r\\n.then(() => {\\r\\n  // ...\\r\\n})\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second `.then` call throws an error because the value that is returned from `act` isn\'t a full-fledged `Promise`, but rather just an object that contains a `.then` method that returns `undefined`. This is fine for simple `async`/`await` cases, but definitely caught me by surprise.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n#### 2. Act discards the returned value.\\r\\n\\r\\nAct also throws away the value returned from the async function callback, which makes it harder to use the values generated there. For example, if I wanted to use the value yielded by `doSomethingAsynchronous`, I would need to introduce a mutable variable:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nlet returnedValue;\\r\\nawait act(async () => {\\r\\n  returnedValue = await doSomethingAsynchronous()\\r\\n})\\r\\n\\r\\n// use returnedValue here\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIf `act` simply propogates the returned value from the asynnchronous callback, this will solve the confusing bits above, allowing for things like:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nconst returnedValue = await act(() => doSomethingAsynchronous())\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n","created_at":"2019-08-12T14:29:50Z"},{"number":16365,"id":479668806,"title":"ErrorBoundary rendering multiple copies of itself when ref assignment fails","user":{"login":"silverwind","id":115237},"state":"open","body":"**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\n\\r\\nbug\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen a error occurs during the assignment of a `ref` (and maybe other conditions), a error boundary wrapping that error may get confused and it renders itself multiple times inside the same parent.

Currently, the delete the content and replace it with a content render in that case. Dropping events and state as a result.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen we\'re already rendering the future state, it is too late to hydrate since we can\'t continue rendering down with the new props/context as it wouldn\'t yield the same result as what was rendered on the server. However, assuming people use immutable data for hydration as they should, then we can solve this problem. We solve it by \\"going back in time\\" to an earlier point on the timeline and hydrate using those props/context. After that is done, we then render the new props/context on top of it.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn practice, this just means that we increase the priority of the hydration to slightly higher than the render that otherwise would have to delete the content.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe also mark this as a \\"bad\\" loading state which means that we\'ll also take advantage of our maximum allowed suspense time to wait for any remaining data/code that we\'d need to complete the hydration.

In order to do this, we need to change how the current event responder system works so that events that are queued to dispatch happen after the processing of each individual responder, rather than at the end.\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously, we built up an array of all user events that needed to be dispatched, along with their priority and dispatched them all together. This made it impossible for user events to have effects that make it possible to control propagation and ownership though, as by this stage, we\'ve already processed the responders. To illustrate this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nResponder A\\r\\n  ->\\r\\n    Responder B\\r\\n      ->\\r\\n        Responder C\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n*Old Model:*\\r\\n\\r\\nIf a native event happens and Responder C gets activated, we then bubble to Responder B and then to Responder A.

Along the way, each responder might `dispatchEvent`, if so, we now dispatch the user events at that point, rather than having to queue them up to flush at the end. We are able to do this by wrapping the entire event process in `batchedEventUpdates` and having a dedicated event that sets a flag for when we\'re in the process of executing a user event. The priority logic from before remains unchanged because of these tweaks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also removed the global ownership model, as this new mechanism allows for a much more refined approach that simply globally saying a responder is the only owner.

However, this complicates the responders and makes it easy to create a problematic unit test environment. jsdom doesn\'t support PointerEvent, which means that the responders end up listening to pointer events *and* fallback events in unit tests. This isn\'t a direct problem in production environments, because no browser will fire pointer events if they aren\'t supported. But in the unit test environment, we often dispatch event sequences taken from browsers that support pointer events. This means that what we\'re often testing is actually a (complex) scenario that cannot even occur in production: a responder that is listening to and receives both pointer events and fallback events. Not only does this risk making responders more complicated to implement but it could also hide bugs in implementations.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Response**\\r\\n\\r\\nImplement the responders so that they\'re only listening to *either* pointer events *or* fallback events, never both. This should make the default pointer events implementations significantly simpler and easier to test, as well as free to rely on the complete PointerEvents API. In the future it should also make DCE easier for target environments that are known to support PointerEvents, as we can use build tools with an equivalent of the runtime check. The fallback events (touch and mouse) need to coexist and be resilient to browser emulated events. Our unit tests should express a suite of high-level interactions that can be run in environments with and without PointerEvents support.","created_at":"2019-08-08T18:15:39Z"},{"number":16319,"id":478567732,"title":"componentDidUpdate not triggered on changes to context","user":{"login":"eyalroth","id":6641808},"state":"closed","body":"**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\nBug.\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\nComponents using a context update their content upon changes to the context, but `render` and `componentDidUpdate` are not invoked even though the the components\' content changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n[Here\'s a JSFiddle example](https://jsfiddle.net/0ewuj8L4/).

The core `react` knows about them but you can only create them from other libs (e.g. `ReactDOM`). You have to branch your code because they can\u2019t be server-side rendered. And so on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is just a pre-RFC to brainstorm ways that Portals can become first-class citizens:\\r\\n\\r\\n* Extend `React.createRef()` to allow an optional renderer-specific argument (e.g. the DOM element), matching `useRef()`\\r\\n* Add `React.createPortal(child, ref)` (*note the use of `ref` rather than a e.g. a direct DOM element*)\\r\\n* Deprecate `ReactDOM.createPortal()`\\r\\n\\r\\nNow with some thought into the structure of your app with modals, they could be e.g. server-side rendered with:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nfunction App(props) {\\r\\n  const modal = useRef(null)\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <div>\\r\\n      <ModalContext.Provider value={modal}>\\r\\n        <div>{props.content}</div>\\r\\n      </ModalContext.Provider>\\r\\n      <div ref={modal} />\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n  )\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction Modal(props) {\\r\\n  const modal = useContext(ModalContext)\\r\\n  return React.createPortal(\\r\\n    props.children,\\r\\n    modal,\\r\\n  )\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// Somewhere in {props.content} tree...\\r\\nreturn (\\r\\n  <>\\r\\n    {visible && (\\r\\n      <Modal>\\r\\n        Hello, World!\\r\\n      </Modal>\\r\\n    )}\\r\\n  </>\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter `ReactDOM.createPortal(...)` is deprecated, legacy web or those with no need to SSR portals can simply upgrade with:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nthis.el = React.createRef(document.createElement(\'div\'))\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nfor the same behavior.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an initial version, React can error if `ref.current` is null when it goes to mount the portal. Some sort of dirty flag could be considered separately if proven necessary, but with the pattern proposed above, it shouldn\u2019t be necessary as the portal host would *always* be mounted first as a natural consequence of how React works.","created_at":"2019-08-08T15:43:18Z"},{"number":16316,"id":478531220,"title":"React\'s Lifecycle is Wrong","user":{"login":"contrarian","id":5007279},"state":"closed","body":"\x3c!--\\r\\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\\r\\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\\r\\n--\x3e\\r\\n\\r\\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\nA bug. \\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\n React currently computes instance lifecycle according to its reconciliation algorithm.

An example of this is using functions like `withTheme()` or `connect()`.\\r\\n \\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport { withItems } from \'../items\'\\r\\n \\r\\nexport const Hello ={ items = [] }) => {\\r\\n  return <div>\\r\\n    { items.map(item => <div>{item}</div>) }\\r\\n  </div>\\r\\n}\\r\\n \\r\\nexport const InjectedHello = withItems(Hello)\\r\\n```\\r\\n \\r\\nWrapping components like this creates silos of troublesome testability and due to it\u2019s unergonomic nature, discourages decoupling components from the surrounding application implementation. \\r\\n \\r\\nIn order to create decoupled component packages (say a UI library that lives in npm), the author must create components which receive all dependencies via props. In order to satisfy these dependencies, a consumer must import the library and re-wrap/re-export every component, injecting their dependencies from a service locator. \\r\\n \\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nimport { Button } from \'generic-ui\'\\r\\nimport { withTheme } from \'../somewhere\' // service locator\\r\\n \\r\\nexport const ThemedButton = withTheme(Button)\\r\\n```\\r\\n \\r\\nA consumer must also exclude the wrapped \u201caware\u201d components from unit tests as it\u2019s impractical to test them in a sensible way.\\r\\n \\r\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern\\r\\n \\r\\nAn example of a basic service locator in JS is here\\r\\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/js-6qzkak\\r\\n \\r\\nAn example of a service locator with React is here\\r\\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/react-tdt624\\r\\n \\r\\n \\r\\n### What about context?\\r\\n \\r\\nContext provides a much more ergonomic solution. It still relies on the same service-locator pattern, but it\u2019s ease of use makes it more approachable.\\r\\n \\r\\nBoiled down, what context simply provides is a vehicle for dependencies to tunnel from their creator to their consumer under the floorboards of the library. It\u2019s essentially an alternative to drilling props from the top level to the embedded components.\\r\\n \\r\\nReceiving the theme from a context `const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)` also relies on the context being supplied by a concrete location.\\r\\n \\r\\nIf you imagine a simple, generic concept like a store using the Flux architecture; utilities like Redux, MobX. These third party libraries *must* have \u201cReact\u201d as a peerDependency. The only alternative is supplying a \\"react-connected\\" variant of their library.\\r\\n \\r\\nFor this reason we have the two packages, \u2018redux\u2019 and \u2018react-redux\u2019. While the latter does provide some convenience utilities, it\'s use is not optional. It _*must*_ exist along-side the original implementation.\\r\\n \\r\\nSo here is a demonstration of how React enforces coupling by not providing an effective means to handle inversion of control. Below I have a factory function which creates a flux store:\\r\\n \\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nexport const createPostStore = () => {\\r\\n  const posts = createStateEmitter([])\\r\\n \\r\\n  const getValue = () => posts.getValue()\\r\\n \\r\\n  const add = (post) => {\\r\\n    posts.setState([\\r\\n      { title: post, id: randomString() },\\r\\n      ...getValue()\\r\\n    ])\\r\\n  }\\r\\n \\r\\n  return {\\r\\n    posts,\\r\\n    getValue,\\r\\n    add\\r\\n  }\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\nIt is consumed like you would consume Redux\\r\\n \\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nconst store = createPostStore()\\r\\nstore.subscribe(posts => console.log(posts))\\r\\nstore.add(\'New Post!\')\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis unit has no external dependencies and can be consumed within React to hold state and trigger re-renders. It is easily tested and can be put in npm without a hard dependency on React.\\r\\n \\r\\nexample:\\r\\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/react-gnj8ba\\r\\n \\r\\nThis example shows \\"prop drilling\\" to get the store into the component. This is ideal from an IoC standpoint, but impractical as with many layers of embedded components, you\'ll pass dependencies down a long tree and it\'s difficult to maintain.\\r\\n \\r\\nOf course, I can simply export a context from my package, but I want to avoid a hard dependency on React as it\'s not really a concern of the library.\\r\\n \\r\\nAnother solution to this problem is to have a shared, global context, where there is a contract that components will consume it and extract their required dependencies from there.\\r\\n \\r\\nhttps://stackblitz.com/edit/react-fz6ue8\\r\\n \\r\\nThe challenge here is that I can\'t expect Bootstrap, Material, or anyone on the internet to `npm install global-context` and have it be the de facto \\"shared context\\" which allows for IoC/agnosticism in component implementations.\\r\\n \\r\\nThe last solution is to make two packages, the package itself and a second package that has a hard dependency on React and exposes a context (Just like Redux and React Redux).\\r\\n \\r\\n### Ok, so what\'s the solution?\\r\\n \\r\\nHard to say. React applications often have many layers of components so any solution must involve supplying embedded components their dependencies in a way that scopes their \\"providing\\" to the current instance of React.\\r\\n \\r\\nSomething like a PropProvider, which supplies props to all embedded components might be a solution. It\'s opt-in making it minimally invasive. It changes nothing for the existing public React API and simply adds another, more flexible, option to a problem you\'d normally `useTheme()` to solve.\\r\\n \\r\\n```jsx\\r\\n<PropProvider values={{ everyone: \'gets this\' }}>\\r\\n    <MyComponent />\\r\\n</PropProvider>\\r\\n```\\r\\n \\r\\nThe problem with this is naming clashes. If you\'re a library vendor, you\'ll need to be creative to avoid clashes. The custom element specification stipulates that you must hyphenate your element names to avoid, or reduce the instances of clashes. Maybe that\'s a solution?\\r\\n \\r\\nAnother option is using getter functions, where key names are nearly impossible to clash and a function knows where to look.\\r\\n \\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nconst MyComponent = (props) => {\\r\\n    const theme = getTheme(props)\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n \\r\\nMaybe an official static context for the react instance?\\r\\n \\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nReactDOM.render(\\r\\n    <App/>,\\r\\n    element,\\r\\n    { everyone: \'gets this\' }\\r\\n)\\r\\n```\\r\\n","created_at":"2019-08-06T03:41:45Z"},{"number":16297,"id":477103923,"title":"Babel 7","user":{"login":"lunaruan","id":2735514},"state":"closed","body":"For #12548 \\r\\n\\r\\nUpgraded from Babel 6 to Babel 7.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe only significant change seems to be the way `@babel/plugin-transform-classes` handles classes differently from `babel-plugin-transform-es2015-classes`.

However, those DOM nodes were already hydrated in\\r\\nthe React tree.

After internal testing and from feedback, it was found that passing responders as a React Element to host components, then having detached listeners led to unnecessary boilerplate and some issues around composability. To address these concerns the follow changes have been made:\\r\\n\\r\\n## `useListener` -> `useResponder`\\r\\n\\r\\nThere was confusion as to why `useListener` was actually using an Event Responder, but was named \\"useListener\\". Now the hook is `useResponder`, which takes an Event Responder and returns and Event Listener. \\r\\n\\r\\n## `responders` prop -> `listeners` prop\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that the `useResponder` hook returns a discrete event listener object, this now gets passed to host components rather than supplying a responder as a React Element on the host component.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo demonstrate these changes, here\'s a before and after:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\n// Before\\r\\nfunction PressableButton({onPress}) {\\r\\n  useListener(PressResponder, {onPress});\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <button responders={<PressResponder />}>Press me</button>\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n// After\\r\\nfunction PressableButton({onPress}) {\\r\\n  const pressListener = useResponder(PressResponder, {onPress});\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <button listeners={pressListener}>Press me</button>\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis design change allows us to explore composing the sequence of listeners, allowing for more complex interactions.

It\'s easy to confuse these two, especially since the DevTools Profiler makes use of the profiling API code. It seems like the profiler API could have a better name though.\\r\\nThe current two use cases it serves:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Count the number of times a subtree commits (in DEV or PROD).\\r\\n2. Record the time spent a subtree (in PROD).\\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately the second metric (time spent) isn\'t all that useful in Concurrent/Batched modes because we reset counters in the case of interruptions or suspends (depending on where the `<React.Profiler>` node is relative to the nearest boundary).\\r\\n\\r\\nIt seems likely that a new API (#15727) may better serve the needs of complex apps using these new APIs. So far as I know, the new events would not be coupled with the `<React.Profiler>` API but would be exposed via something new.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Conclusion\\r\\n\\r\\nGiven this, we discussed potential new names on the team and the one that had the most support was `SubtreeProfiler`.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, after looking closer at what would be involved in this rename- I am no longer sure it\'s worth the effort, given all of the places we would need to change:\\r\\n\\r\\n* We have already released a stable version of `react-is` with `Profiler` and `isProfiler` exports, so we\'ll need to keep those around until v17.\\r\\n* This also impacts DevTools since it would have to continue to support the old `Symbol.for(\'react.profiler\')`.\\r\\n\\r\\n### Overall, I like this name _better_ but I\'m not convinced that it\'s _enough better_ to warrant the hassle.

When using mouse events (via pointer events or mouse events), we have a guarantee that the event target will be that of the one we\'re moving/releasing from (unlike touch events, which can have the same target as when the press was initiated). This mechanic for mouse events lets us bypass the `getBoundingClientRect` logic, which is:\\r\\n\\r\\n- expensive as it requires a layout reflow\\r\\n- can be incorrect in cases where children of the `responderTarget` are absolutely positioned\\r\\n- can sometimes report `width` and/or `height` as `0` when some CSS styles are applied\\r\\n\\r\\nThis behaviour already existed in the current Press implementation. But there were two bugs:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `isTargetWithinNode` wasn\'t taking into account the `alternate` fiber\\r\\n- we weren\'t setting `isPressWithinResponderRegion` to `true` if we knew the mouse event target was in the responder region (by using the targets).\\r\\n\\r\\nThis fixes both cases, which also fixes the internal bug we were seeing.","created_at":"2019-07-22T11:12:52Z"},{"number":16171,"id":470895252,"title":"[custom renderer] weird behavior of the useState hook","user":{"login":"krasimir","id":528677},"state":"closed","body":"**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\n\\r\\nnot a bug nor a feature (I probably missed something in my custom renderer host config)\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nI have the following example:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nfunction XXX() {\\r\\n  const [ counter, setCounter ] = useState(0);\\r\\n  console.log(counter);\\r\\n  useEffect(() => {\\r\\n    setCounter(42);\\r\\n  }, [])\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <span style={ { cursor: \'pointer\' } } onClick={ () => setCounter(counter + 1) }>\\r\\n      XXX({ counter })\\r\\n    </span>\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\nfunction App() {\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <XXX />\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\nBanana.render(<App />, document.querySelector(\'#root\'));\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAll works fine until I click on the `XXX(42)` text.

If this happens at the beginning of a frame, the callback might not fire until the subsequent frame, even if the main thread is idle.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur theory was that this wouldn\'t be an issue in practice, because once the first rAF fires, we schedule the next rAF as early as possible in that frame. Combined with our heuristic for computing frame deadlines, we shouldn\'t get any idle time in between frames \u2014 only before the *first* frame.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis reasoning holds true when you have a small number of large tasks, such as the ones posted by React. The idle time before the task starts is negligible relative to the lifetime of the entire task.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, it does not hold if you have many small tasks posted over a span of time, perhaps spawned by a flurry of IO events. In this case, instead of single, contiguous rAF loop preceded by an idle frame, you get many rAF loops preceded by many idle frames. Our new theory is that this is contributing to poor main thread utilization during page loads.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo try to reclaim as much idle time as possible, this PR adds two experimental flags. The first one adds a `requestIdleCallback` call to start the rAF loop, which will fire before rAF if there\'s idle time left in the frame. (We still call rAF in case there isn\'t. We start working in whichever event fires first.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second flag tries a similar strategy using `setTimeout(fn, 0)`. If the timer fires before rAF, we\'ll assume that the main thread is idle.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf either `requestIdleCallback` or `setTimeout` fires before rAF, we\'ll immediately perform some work. Since we don\'t have a real frame time that we can use to compute the frame deadline, we might miss the next vsync, but this is fine because we can catch up during the next frame, by which point a real rAF will have fired and the loop can proceed the same way it does today.\\r\\n\\r\\nTest plan: Try this on Facebook to see if it improves load times.","created_at":"2019-07-20T01:39:17Z"},{"number":16165,"id":470604166,"title":"Unexpected behavior with ref callback and focus()","user":{"login":"ZYinMD","id":32368482},"state":"closed","body":"**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\\r\\nbug (I know it\'s more likely a bug of my own code, but I can\'t find out why)\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\n### [CodeSandbox Demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/quizzical-gagarin-bzvf1)\\r\\nIt\'s really hard to describe my issue in English, the only way to understand is looking at the demo.

This is a follow up to #16101 and #16122. This design tackles the problems already outlined in those PRs.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe design system now consists of two key parts:\\r\\n- responders (created via `React.unstable_createResponder`)\\r\\n- listeners (used via `React.unstable_useListener`)\\r\\n\\r\\nResponders work pretty much like how they did before, except they\'re no longer consumed via Event Components, but are rather passed directly as an array to host components:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport {PressResponder} from \'react-events/press\';\\r\\n\\r\\n<div responders={<PressResponder />} />\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nHost components can have multiple event responders, but any duplicate event responders are a warning and no-op. Event responders do not emit events, but they do accept optional props:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport {PressResponder} from \'react-events/press\';\\r\\n\\r\\n<div responders={<PressResponder preventDefault={false} />} />\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you give a responder to a host component, there\'s a binding between that host component and the logic from within the relevant event responder implementation. The host component is also the \\"responder target\\" from there on too. Event responders act like a sort of event emitter, where they listen to native DOM events, but emit custom React Flare events.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvent listeners then pick up the React Flare events as the propagate through the React fiber tree. Event listeners are used exclusively in hook form:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nReact.useListener(EventResponder, props)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nExample:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nimport {usePressListener, PressResponder} from \'react-events/press\'l\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction MyComponent() {\\r\\n  usePressListener({ onPress: handlePress });\\r\\n\\r\\n  function handlePress(e) {\\r\\n    console.log(\'You pressed the div!\');\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n  return <div responders={<PressResonder />}>Press me!</div>\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nEvents emitted from responders will terminate if they propagate the tree and hit another responder of the same type:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nfunction MyComponent() {\\r\\n  // this won\'t get events from the inner div\\r\\n  usePressListener({ onPress: handlePress });\\r\\n\\r\\n  function handlePress(e) {\\r\\n    console.log(\'You pressed the div!\');\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <div responders={<PressResonder />}>\\r\\n        <div responders={<PressResonder />}>\\r\\n          Inner div\\r\\n        </div>\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIf the desired effect is to listen from events, an appropiate component boundary with a hook should be inserted, or another event responder should be used (i.e. `PressWithin`?).\\r\\n\\r\\nIf there are multiple responders in a sub-tree that can be intercepted by the same listener, like show:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nfunction MyComponent() {\\r\\n  usePressListener({ onPress: handlePress });\\r\\n\\r\\n  function handlePress(e) {\\r\\n    console.log(\'You pressed the div!\');\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <React.Fragment>\\r\\n      <div responders={<PressResonder />}>Div 1</div>\\r\\n      <div responders={<PressResonder />}>Div 2</div>\\r\\n    </React.Fragment>\\r\\n  );\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThen to only intercept a single event, the children should be broken into sub components that then listen to only the things it wants to be concerned about. It\'s also possible to determine the child being pressed by other mechanisms (`event.target` and maybe a future `event.responderProps`).\\r\\n\\r\\nCompared to the previous event system design in Flare:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nfunction PressableButton({children, onPress, onHover, onFocus}) {\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <Press onPress={onPress}>\\r\\n      <Hover onHover={onHover}>\\r\\n        <Focus onFocus={onFocus}>\\r\\n          <div>\\r\\n            {children}\\r\\n          </div>\\r\\n        </Focus>\\r\\n      </Hover>\\r\\n    </Press>\\r\\n  )\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this PR and design, you would do this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nfunction PressableButton({children, onPress, onHover, onFocus}) {\\r\\n  usePressResponder({onPress});\\r\\n  useHoverResponder({onHover});\\r\\n  useFocusResponder({onFocus});\\r\\n\\r\\n  return (\\r\\n    <div responders={[<PressResponder/ >, <FocusResponder />, <HoverResponder />]}>\\r\\n      {children}\\r\\n    </div>\\r\\n  )\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nNote: there are no fibers created for this new event system design. Instead we attached objects to the existing fibers in the tree already, or use hooks.\\r\\n","created_at":"2019-07-19T13:37:56Z"},{"number":16162,"id":470234979,"title":"Once again on getDerivedStateFromProps being called after setState","user":{"login":"sarat12","id":1218708},"state":"closed","body":"I\'ve read all the issues end blog posts on this topic and still can\'t find suitable solution for my case.

Colloquially, DOM API becomes strongly typed.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, with Trusted Types Element.innerHTML property setter accepts a TrustedHTML object.\\r\\n\\r\\nTrusted Type objects stringify to their inner value. This API shape is a deliberate choice that enables existing web applications and libraries to gradually migrate from strings to Trusted Types without breaking functionality. In our example, it makes it possible to write the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n```javascript\\r\\nconst policy = TrustedTypes.createPolicy(\'foo\', { \\r\\n  createHTML: (s) => { /* some validation*/; return s} \\r\\n});\\r\\n\\r\\nconst trustedHTML = policy.createHTML(\'bar\');\\r\\nanElement.innerHTML = trustedHTML\\r\\n\\r\\nanElement.innerHTML === \'bar\'\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above code works regardless if the Trusted Types enforcement is enabled or not.\\r\\n\\r\\nReading from the DOM is unaffected, so Element.innerHTML getter returns a string. That\'s for practical reasons -- web applications read from DOM more often than they write to it, and only writing exposes the application to DOM XSS risks. Typing only the setters allows us to secure web applications with minimal code changes.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Adding Trusted Types to React for client side\\r\\nReact applications rarely manipulate DOM directly as this is what React is for. That means that, if users want to opt in to Trusted Types, values assigned to execution sinks must be trusted. React on its own doesn\'t produce these execution sinks, except one [hack for IE](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b4178af81b02dfa0e898670ce564c4649fd8947f/packages/react-dom/src/client/setInnerHTML.js#L34). The only problem in React is the stringifying of values before assigning them to element properties or attributes. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis PR enables applications to use Trusted Types on client side. The implementation removes stringifying of trusted values in reactDOM/client. It does so **only** when Trusted Types are available in global object. If they are available, there are special [is* functions](https://wicg.github.io/trusted-types/dist/spec/#dom-trustedtypepolicyfactory-ishtml) which are used to check if the value is trusted type or not. If the value is a trusted type, we return the value itself, otherwise we preserve the original logic and stringify the value.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Problems\\r\\n**We cannot use Trusted Types in Internet Explorer (IE) when using dangerouslySetInnerHTML on svg elements** - The cause is that in IE svg elements doesn\'t have innerHTML property, which means that to support innerHTML, react needs to use a [hack](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b4178af81b02dfa0e898670ce564c4649fd8947f/packages/react-dom/src/client/setInnerHTML.js#L34), which wraps the innerHTML of the svg and wraps them in an svg element and assigns this to innerHTML of some HTML element. This is a problem for Trusted Types because the original svg innerHTML value is stringified. There are a few workarounds for this:\\r\\na) Use default Trusted Type policy allowing creating svg nodes\\r\\nb) Do not use svg with dangerouslySetInnerHTML but wrap the svg with div element and use dangerouslySetInnerHTML there \\r\\n     \\r\\n## Reference\\r\\n* [Draft: Add trusted types to react on server side](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16555)\\r\\n\\r\\n## Update\\r\\n* [TrustedURLs are deprecated](https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types/pull/204) and are going to be replaced with default policy call on javascript URLs ([which are deprecated in React and will not be supported in the future release](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/15047/files)).\\r\\n* [window.TrustedTypes is going to be renamed to window.trustedTypes](https://github.com/WICG/trusted-types/pull/205) (with lowercase **t**)","created_at":"2019-07-18T19:46:46Z"},{"number":16156,"id":469751343,"title":"recommend react-codemod@next until we actually ship","user":{"login":"threepointone","id":18808},"state":"closed","body":"This changest the UNSAFE_ lifecycle recommendation to `npx react-codemod@next ...`, in preparation for the release.

However, in some cases you may want to avoid re-triggering the callback ref when one of those external values change. In that case, you could use `useRef` to work around this, and update the ref\'s value with `useEffect`/`useLayoutEffect`, like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nconst valueRef = useRef(value);\\r\\nuseEffect(() => {\\r\\n  valueRef.current = value;\\r\\n}, [value]);\\r\\n\\r\\n// Now the callback ref can use `valueRef.current`\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, callback refs are called before `useEffect`/`useLayoutEffect` callbacks, so if the callback ref happens to be triggered as a result of the same render in which `value` changes, it will see the old value when it access `valueRef.current`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis could be worked around by updating `valueRef` as a side effect of render:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nconst valueRef = useRef(value);\\r\\nvalueRef.current = value;\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThis is admittedly a very specific edge case, but I have actually introduced bugs into real code due to this, when trying to convert existing class components to use hooks. Another motivation for this is to use it to help implement a custom hook for making callback refs nicer to use by mimicking the `useEffect` API: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15176#issuecomment-512185852\\r\\n\\r\\nInterestingly, this issue does not happen with class components, because `this.props` and `this.state` have the correct value when the callback ref is triggered.\\r\\n\\r\\nHere is a codesandbox with a contrived example that reproduces the issue (and shows how the issue does not occur with a class component): https://codesandbox.io/s/callback-refhooks-72m3p\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\n\\r\\nThat there is some way of handling this use case using hooks, and in such a way that works with concurrent mode:\\r\\n\\r\\n\u2022 Wanting to access external values in a callback ref\\r\\n\u2022 Wanting to avoid triggering the callback ref when those values change\\r\\n\\r\\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

Every single question I found on Stack Overflow about this invariant was someone not understanding how JSX works and calling `.setState()` in `.render()`, which isn\'t at all what I\'m doing.  I don\'t understand why the detection for _infinite_ loops is set to such a low threshold.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn my opinion, `NESTED_UPDATE_LIMIT` should be at least 10x higher.  It\'ll still catch infinite loops just fine, and won\'t take much longer to do so, but won\'t kick my ass for having the audacity to use several libraries and a reasonably deep structure.\\r\\n\\r\\nFailing that, it should be configurable.  As I said, I\'m using expo, which I believe means there\'s no way for me to change this value when publishing my app.  I can edit it in `node_modules/` just fine on my local machine (and the error goes away of course), but with no way to do so on the build servers, I can\'t make this app.  Not with react, anyway.  I really don\'t want that to be the case, because I\'ve been building this for months, at this point, and starting over in swift or whatever would be an awful cost to my employers just because someone thought \\"50 is enough for anyone\\".  :/\\r\\n\\r\\nAs it seems like the expo bootstrapping layers are being ignored, I\'m going to start diving in to that code now to see if I can steal its ideas, but of course I shouldn\'t have to.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

The shared array buffer contains (only in the profiling and development builds)\\r\\n\\r\\n- the priority at which Scheduler is currently running (or 0 if it\'s not)\\r\\n- the size of the queue\\r\\n- the id of the currently running task (if applicable)\\r\\n- a unique \\"run id\\" per block (if applicable)\\r\\n\\r\\nRegarding the last point each synchronous block of Scheduler work is given a unique run ID. This is different than a task ID because a single task will have more than one run if it yields with a continuation.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe worker thread can use this information to construct a flamegraph. The advantage of the sample-based approach is that it scales in proportion to the available resources \u2014 if the CPU slows down, the sample rate slows down accordingly.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Event-based approach\\r\\n\\r\\nThe disadvantage of the sample-based approach is that it doesn\'t during the very first part of page initialization, before the worker has initialized.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo address this problem, there\'s a separate feature to write to a log of events: `startLoggingProfilerEvents` and `stopLoggingProfilerEvents`.\\r\\n\\r\\n`stopLoggingProfilerEvents` returns a typed, 32-bit integer array buffer (though not a shared array buffer).

Everytime I click on Apply on a column filter, I need to get the previously checked values as well.\\r\\n\\r\\nCan someone help me with this:\\r\\n\\r\\nCode Sandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/quizzical-glitter-np8iw\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nApp Component\\r\\n----------------\\r\\n`````````````````````\\r\\nimport * as React from \\"react\\";\\r\\nimport { render } from \\"react-dom\\";\\r\\nimport ReactTable from \\"react-table\\";\\r\\nimport \\"./styles.css\\";\\r\\nimport \\"react-table/react-table.css\\";\\r\\nimport DropDownComponent from \\"./DropDown\\";\\r\\ninterface IState {\\r\\n  data: {}[];\\r\\n  columns: {}[];\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\ninterface IProps {}\\r\\n\\r\\nexport default class App extends React.Component<IProps, IState> {\\r\\n  constructor(props: any) {\\r\\n    super(props);\\r\\n    this.state = {\\r\\n      data: [\\r\\n        { firstName: \\"aaaaa\\", status: \\"Pending\\", visits: 155 },\\r\\n        { firstName: \\"aabFaa\\", status: \\"Pending\\", visits: 155 },\\r\\n        { firstName: \\"adaAAaaa\\", status: \\"Approved\\", visits: 1785 },\\r\\n        { firstName: \\"aAaaaa\\", status: \\"Approved\\", visits: 175 },\\r\\n        { firstName: \\"adaSaaa\\", status: \\"Cancelled\\", visits: 165 },\\r\\n        { firstName: \\"aaaaa\\", status: \\"Cancelled\\", visits: 157 },\\r\\n        { firstName: \\"aaaaa\\", status: \\"Approved\\", visits: 153 },\\r\\n        { firstName: \\"aaaaa\\", status: \\"Pending\\", visits: 155 }\\r\\n      ],\\r\\n      columns: []\\r\\n    };\\r\\n  }\\r\\n\\r\\n  handleSetState = (columns: any) => {\\r\\n    this.setState({ columns });\\r\\n  };\\r\\n\\r\\n  handleSetData = (value: any) => {\\r\\n    console.log(value); // Here filtering logic is written, I need to get the data from DropDown Component.

This is the nearest host component parent to the event responder.\\r\\n- We now resolve responders as a property of the thing we\'re interacting with, rather than wrapping around it. This provides an important constraint around how event responders are used, in that it makes extending an abstraction from the outside harder rather than easier.\\r\\n- By making a responder a child of the target, we can handle conditional cases with ease (the event responder will unmount/mount).\\r\\n- A target can only have a single type of event responder at a given time. If multiple event responders try to attach to the same target and they are the same event responder, only the first will register and the others will be no-ops (with dev warnings).\\r\\n- Unlike the other design, using `ref`s is somewhat error prone. The same ref might be passed around and assign conditionally or multiple times, which would be difficult to detect and handle.","created_at":"2019-07-12T13:36:43Z"},{"number":16121,"id":467385397,"title":"useEffect will unpredictable when depends on ref (useRef)","user":{"login":"lihroff","id":24240963},"state":"closed","body":"Look at this [demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/useeffect-depends-on-useref-194ec)\\r\\nIs there a bug?\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the current behavior?**\\r\\nWhen you click the minus button until value to -1,  the # 1 effect will not be triggered, but the dependency has changed.\\r\\n\\r\\n**What is the expected behavior?**\\r\\nThe # 1 effect will be trigger when the value changes from 0 to -1\uff0cjust like # 2 effect","created_at":"2019-07-12T12:22:15Z"},{"number":16120,"id":467322717,"title":"[react-cache] [Question] Feedback and stale-while-revalidate strategy","user":{"login":"nulladdict","id":26379644},"state":"closed","body":"First of all, I am aware that `react-cache` package is highly experimental and unstable, but I still would like to experiment and express my thoughts on the subject. (skip to the end for the actual question)\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ve tried using it in several fun projects, and in my experience current version works pretty well with anything static, e.g. resources that need to be loaded only once, or can be loaded once and updated separately.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, not all resources are like that, and some of them need cache invalidation.  This https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14783#issuecomment-461860954 mentions that there is no API for invalidation, but you can actually invalidate the resource, using the clever hash function. I\'ve put together a little [demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-cache-stale-while-revalidate-startegy-0o9jj).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem with that approach is that invalidations happens \\"soundly\\" and will trigger the suspense. \\r\\n\\r\\nThis could be solved by busting the cache only after the `preload` of the next entry already happened, but there\'s unfortunately no way to track the `preload` state of the next entry, since the `preload` method actually doesn\'t return the promise it called;\\r\\n\\r\\nAnother way to go around this issue is to have a side effect inside the async resource, that would cause a re-render when completed, thus giving the ability to invalidate the old entry only after the new entry has been completed;\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly there\u2019s the ability to create a invalidation method, wrapping a `read` method in a try-catch block and have custom logic of resolving with a result / awaiting  a suspender. This however makes the invalidation async, but it\'s probably fine, since we only need to invalidate the cache after we already have the initial result and can update the result when the invalidation has already happened.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince the first approach is basically impossible with current cache package and later two required a lot of custom logic, one would probably be better of writing an entirely custom suspender and cache provider with a required strategy.\\r\\n\\r\\nSorry for the long read, thus comes the question:\\r\\n\\r\\n**TLDR:** Is `react-cache` being developed and presented as a low-level API for writing custom resource caching logic OR as an example of writing custom suspenders and cache strategies?","created_at":"2019-07-12T09:46:28Z"},{"number":16119,"id":467234419,"title":"How to make button clickable under Link","user":{"login":"nonanonakeita","id":51696880},"state":"closed","body":"Post.jsx file\\r\\nCode below is Post itself...\\r\\n```\\r\\n<Post>\\r\\n     <Link to=\'/somewhere\'>\\r\\n         <contents>\\r\\n             <usename />\\r\\n              <date />\\r\\n              <div onClick={doSomething}>Edit</div>\\r\\n         </contents>\\r\\n     </Link>\\r\\n</Post>\\r\\n```\\r\\nHow can I make the div tag button clickable under Link?\\r\\n\\r\\nI wanna implement like this...\\r\\nIf I click anywhere in the post except edit button, I go to post detail page.\\r\\nIf click edit button, edit modal shows up instead of going to post detail page.\\r\\nI believed I need to nest edit button trigger in the Link, but doesnt work.\\r\\nHow am I supposed to implement this?\\r\\nThank you.\\r\\n\\r\\nLIke this...\\r\\n![facebook_1199-141](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51696880/61104391-2d701e80-a4b1-11e9-9d9b-39207d0d34cc.jpg)","created_at":"2019-07-12T05:53:35Z"},{"number":16118,"id":467182568,"title":".watchmanconfig must be valid json","user":{"login":"acdlite","id":3624098},"state":"closed","body":"faceworldproblems?","created_at":"2019-07-12T01:56:32Z"},{"number":16117,"id":467181467,"title":"is this a bug?","user":{"login":"bochen2014","id":8207081},"state":"closed","body":"I didn\'t see it\'s mentioned somewhere else so I\'d try to open a new thread for it.

I know the rationale behind this is to encourage use of the function component pattern, and allow for future optimization work in the form of precompilation. However, it makes it very inconvenient to use modern hooks-based libraries in class components, and you\'re essentially forced to resort to using a higher order component instead, if one is even provided. \\r\\nFor instance, included with the react-i18next library is a very convenient `useTranslation` hook, yet, if you\'re localizing class components, you must wrap everything with a HOC, since the library no longer includes a decorator. The HOC pattern is especially nasty with Typescript since you essentially have to add a bunch of extra properties to your component\'s props interface and then have the HOC function strip them with a compound type.\\r\\n\\r\\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn\'t have dependencies other than React.

It even works with custom hooks provided by third party libraries, since the built-in hooks they call are wrapped. We\'re currently using this with the `useTranslation` hook from react-i18next with no issues. \\r\\nI can\'t see any reason why this shouldn\'t be available natively, if only for compatibility and migration purposes. Render methods are just functions, and hooks are simply a way to allow repeated function calls to access persistent state from a backing list, correct? The hooks API documentation states that you shouldn\'t bother to refactor all your class components just for hooks, and even if that sort of usage wouldn\'t be possible to optimize through precompilation, allowing it would significantly ease the transition.\\r\\nThe only potential caveat is the common class component pattern of delegating out to subordinate render methods, in which hooks wouldn\'t work properly if they\'re called conditionally or in a loop. This can be avoided by passing hooked values from the top level render method instead.\\r\\n\\r\\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

Notably, there are now no Event Components, instead as the first of this new design there are only Event Responders. The only way to use an Event Responder is by using its hook form inside a functional component that you want to \\"tie\\" to becoming an event target for the responder in question.\\r\\n\\r\\nBefore you would do:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nfunction PressableButton({children, onPress, onHover, onFocus}) {\\r\\n  <Press onPress={onPress}>\\r\\n    <Hover onHover={onHover}>\\r\\n      <Focus onFocus={onFocus}>\\r\\n        <div>\\r\\n          {children}\\r\\n        </div>\\r\\n      </Focus>\\r\\n    </Hover>\\r\\n  </Press>\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this PR, you now do:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\nfunction PressableButton({children, onPress, onHover, onFocus}) {\\r\\n  const targetRef= useRef(null);\\r\\n  usePressResponder(targetRef, {onPress});\\r\\n  useHoverResponder(targetRef, {onHover});\\r\\n  useFocusResponder(targetRef, {onFocus});\\r\\n  return <div ref={targetRef}>{children}</div>\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n## The reasons for this change:\\r\\n- There is now an explicit contract between an event responder at the function component that owns it (using the hook design). This creates a boundary for any given responders inside the boundary, so they don\'t bubble up the fiber tree.\\r\\n- There is also an explicit contract between a responder and a host target. Before, there was no clear way to provide a 1:1 contract.\\r\\n- We create less fibers and objects with this model, whilst in the case before, each event component would have an associated fiber for each one in the tree.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Issues with Event Components:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s difficult to compose event components without falling into pitfalls. The majority if event components have a 1:1 mapping to a DOM node, meaning they need a static child that remains constant through the lifecycle of the event responder. This is easy to visualize in this case:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\n<Focus>\\r\\n  <button>Focus me!</button>\\r\\n</Focus>\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s harder to track and warn about (without overhead) in cases where the node might resolve conditionally:\\r\\n\\r\\n```jsx\\r\\n<Focus>\\r\\n  <SomeComponent />\\r\\n</Focus>\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction SomeComponent() {\\r\\n  return condition ? <button>Focus me!</button> : <span>Focus me!</span>\\r\\n}\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s even harder when the child might suspend or lazyily change. Not to mention, there\'s not a consistent story with event components. `<FocusScope>` might want to accept many children, yet is still an event component, whilst `<Focus>` clearly does not.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis updated design attempts to tackle some of those concerns.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Note:\\r\\n\\r\\nIt\'s important to remember that this is still experimental and may change at any time. We expect `useResponder` to be used sparingly \u2013 almost as if it as private API \u2013 to be used in core primitive componets that are the building blocks for an app. In later PRs, we will expose `createListener` and `useListener` which will be used as more of a public facing API to be used in user-space components.","created_at":"2019-07-10T18:03:46Z"},{"number":16100,"id":466392637,"title":"[Flare] Press includes button type","user":{"login":"necolas","id":239676},"state":"closed","body":"1.

Virtual DOM in React provides good help for performance issues, but sometimes you need to go further and operate on level of vanilla js with incremental changes and custom virtual DOM model relevant to your application.

One of the common problems I usually get with hooks, is to access the latest state/props in `useEffect` and `useCallback`, while avoiding specify too many dependencies to these hooks. \\r\\n\\r\\n(I\'m aware of exhausive deps, but for optimization, I don\'t want `useEffect` to be called too many times, or `useCallback` to return a different function every times)\\r\\n\\r\\nFor example, I want to maintain the identity of function returned from `useCallback`, so I\'d need to put `[]` as 2nd argument (because I\'m gonna pass it to a component inside `React.memo` and don\'t want to write custom props comparator). So it\'d be like this:\\r\\n```js\\r\\nuseCallback(() => doStuff(value1, value2), [])\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course it won\'t work because `doStuff` will always receive initial value of `value1` and `value2`. That\'s why I\'d need to use `useRef`:\\r\\n\\r\\n```js\\r\\nconst ref = useRef({ value1, value2 });\\r\\nref.current = { value1, value2 };\\r\\nuseCallback(() => doStuff(ref.current.value1, ref.current.value2), [])\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd could say that this happens so many time that I decided to write a custom hook for it :)\\r\\n\\r\\n```ts\\r\\nexport function useCallbackWithRef<TRef, TCb extends (...args: any[]) => any>(\\r\\n  refData: TRef,\\r\\n  callback: (refData: TRef) => TCb\\r\\n): TCb {\\r\\n  const ref = React.useRef(refData);\\r\\n  ref.current = refData;\\r\\n  return React.useCallback((...args: any[]) => {\\r\\n    return callback(ref.current)(...args);\\r\\n  }, []) as TCb;\\r\\n}\\r\\n\\r\\n//usage\\r\\nuseCallbackWithRef({ value1, value2 }, ref => () => doStuff(ref.value1, ref.value2))\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd it seems to work quite nice: [Codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/white-brook-1myr7)\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'m going to use this across many places in my project, but I don\'t want to have many regrets later on so I just want to ask a few things:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Is there any performance issue with excessive use of `useRef`? Since they\'re just pointer to an already exist object, I guess it\'s not going to have any memory impact?\\r\\n2. I read somewhere that React may decide to re-compute value in `useMemo` if needed, even if I specify `[]` as dependencies. Is it better if I change the implementation to `useState` with lazy init, instead of `useCallback`?\\r\\n3.

Others could be related to leaks that exists but the way React works makes them larger than they otherwise would\'ve.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Actionable\\r\\n\\r\\nI think there are at least two actionable patterns to address from #15157:\\r\\n\\r\\n- [ ] If a handle on a DOM node is leaked, it takes the React tree with it. This is a fairly easy mistake to make and the effect is pretty high. What we would do here is special case DOM nodes with refs on them, and always detach their back pointer to the React Fiber, if it was ever fully mounted. We currently traverse these trees anyway when they get deleted. We want to stop doing this for most things but for nodes with a ref it seems minor to special case since they typically need to be invoked with null anyway.\\r\\n- [ ] Investigate the source of the leak in https://github.com/jonnycornwell/potential_react_leak and fix the source of the problem.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Unresolved\\r\\n\\r\\n- [ ] Closing over setState/dispatch or class component instances to global state can leak too.

I could imagine some patterns where this is the complete solution but unclear if it\'s the complete solution for the patterns that people are actually hitting in practice.\\r\\n- [ ] What other issues remain after solving the actionable above? Let\'s make another pass investigating if people\'s original issues remain.\\r\\n\\r\\n# Won\'t Fix\\r\\n\\r\\n- Side-effects in class constructor, componentWillMount, componentWillReceiveProps, componentWillUpdate, getDerivedStateFrom... and render that store a reference to anything stateful outside React won\'t be able to clean up. This is [documented](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/27/update-on-async-rendering.html) in the 16.3 release and is a major design decision as part of the concurrent/suspense/error handling strategy.\\r\\n- Effects/state retained temporarily in alternate fiber likely won\'t be fixed short term. This is due to how Fiber uses two trees and swaps between them. This can lead to additional values being retained until that tree gets some work on it to swap again. This was observed in the Hooks release and there are some confusing cases where a destroy function can hold onto more memory than expected in the closure. Typically this is solved by using a custom hook since that gets its own scope/closure.\\r\\n- Props/child trees retained by alternate children. Similarly, children that was just removed can sometimes between retained by the alternate copy of that. That is until that node gets another update on it which clears out the old children. These cases are fairly unusual and fix themselves eventually as the app lives on.","created_at":"2019-07-09T00:17:45Z"},{"number":16086,"id":465434452,"title":"useContext unexpected behavior in immediate child component","user":{"login":"HosseinAlipour","id":5198502},"state":"closed","body":"as [hook API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext) states, The current context value is determined by the value prop of the nearest <MyContext.Provider> ***above the calling component in the tree.*** \\r\\n\\r\\nbut before react new Hooks feature, we could use provider and consumer in the same component and the consumer always points to the nearest component, not nearest above the calling component.\\r\\n\\r\\nthis [sandbox ](https://codesandbox.io/s/gallant-elgamal-23r81) shows that only the useContext has unexpected behavior based on other methods of accessing context value.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think this is by hook\'s limit, or isn\'t it?\\r\\nso based on what premise useContext doesn\'t provide the value form the nearest provider? isn\'t it unexpected?\\r\\n","created_at":"2019-07-08T20:01:01Z"},{"number":16085,"id":465427706,"title":"[Fabric] Add dispatchCommand to React Native renderers","user":{"login":"TheSavior","id":249164},"state":"closed","body":"We are adding dispatchCommand to the export of React Native renderers.

I think this is a fairly common pattern.\\r\\n\\r\\nFirst of all notice how I\'m using `useMemo`, as we want to attach `then`/`catch` handlers only once.\\r\\n\\r\\nSecondly notice how inside `useMemo` I\'m resetting the `result` object whenever the promise changes, as we don\'t want it to return the previous result object instead.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'m resetting the `result` object both permanently, via `setResult`, and temporarily, by assigning to it directly. I believe the direct assignment is necessary here because otherwise my component will immediately receive the previous `result` object instead of the new one.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are multiple issues even with this fairly simple hook:\\r\\n\\r\\n### 1 - Inappropriate linter warning\\r\\n\\r\\nThe linter is complaining about assigning directly to `result` with the following message:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\nAssignments to the \'result\' variable from inside React Hook useMemo will be lost after each render. To preserve the value over time, store it in a useRef Hook and keep the mutable value in the \'.current\' property. Otherwise, you can move this variable directly inside useMemo.eslint(react-hooks/exhaustive-deps)\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nSince I\'m also using `setResult` here this issue seems none existent, maybe this warning shouldn\'t be displayed in this situation?\\r\\n\\r\\n### 2 - Missing linter warning\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I don\'t update the `result` variable immediately by directly assigning to it my component will initially receive the wrong object, which is an error, and I think it will also be rendered twice, once with the wrong object, and a second time with the right one once `setResult` does its job.\\r\\n\\r\\nShouldn\'t in situations like this be a linter rule that _encourages_, instead of discourages, you to also update the value directly in order to avoid those issues?\\r\\n\\r\\n### 3 - Updating state while the component is unmounted\\r\\n\\r\\nI think my `usePromise` hook will eventually call `setResult` while the component is unmounted because the promise will eventually resolve/reject after the component has been unmounted.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo I\'ll have to update it to check if the component is still mounted, otherwise React will log an error about this.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat\'s the point of this error? Why can\'t/shouldn\'t React itself just ignore my `setResult` call if the component is not mounted? Or at the very least why is React logging an error about this and not a warning?\\r\\n\\r\\nI find myself stumbling into this issue pretty often, perhaps a linter rule can be written about this?\\r\\n\\r\\n### 4 - Which hook to use?\\r\\n\\r\\nIf I\'m understanding this correctly instead of `useMemo` I could have used `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect` and have gotten _almost_ the same result, I say almost because:\\r\\n\\r\\n- `useMemo` calls the passed function immediately, which is want we want or the promise may throw an exception that we won\'t be able to catch.\\r\\n- `useLayoutEffect` would call the passed function at a later time, right before the browser is ready to render the frame, or at least I believe that\'s the case, but if I have 10 `useLayoutEffect` calls and the first one keeps the main thread busy for 1 minute are the other 9 always going to get executed before the browser paints?\\r\\n- `useEffect` will call the passed function at a point in time that\'s not very clear to me. (e.g. should it be equivalent to `componentDidMount` + `componentWillUnmount`? Or was it `componentWillMount` + `componentDidUnmount` or some other permutation?)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fact that there are 3 built-in hooks that could be used for this, which may not reveal any error for a long time, is a bit confusing to me.\\r\\n\\r\\n### General feedback\\r\\n\\r\\nI\'ve recently migrated an app of mine to hooks and this particular issue has bit me more than once already, I keep stumbling upon it. In general I\'m having troubles writing reliable custom hooks and components.\\r\\n\\r\\n1. There\'s no linter rule that reminds me to also update the value provided by `useState` hooks immediately, in fact it seems the current one discourages it.\\r\\n2. I think my components have become harder to reason about sometimes: \\r\\n\\t- If I call `setFoo` 10 times is my component going to render 10 times?\\r\\n\\t- Will React re-render my component also if I pass `setFoo` the same exact value as before?\\r\\n\\t- If I use `useState` 3 times, and call the related `set*` methods from inside 3 `useEffect` hooks, one for each, is my component going to render 4 times if the first `useEffect` block relies on and updates the value provided by the first `useState`, the second `useEffect` block relies on the value provided by the first `useState` call too and updates the second, and the third `useEffect` block relies on the value provided by the second `useState` call and updates the third? And shouldn\'t I try to minimize these renderings by updating those values via an assignment also? \\r\\n\\t- I basically use `useEffect` by default, but some times I see a bit of flickering/glitches in the UI, I replace it with `useLayoutEffect` instead, the issue gets fixed, and I notice that I\'m actually mutating the DOM or something inside the hook.\\r\\n\\t\\t- I find this to be quite error-prone for me, as sometimes it\'s not clear that I\'m actually mutating the DOM (say I want to update the `scrollTop` property of an element or something), as the line that actually does that may be abstracted away by some other high-level API.\\r\\n\\t\\t- I also find the mere existence of 2 effect-related hooks confusing, I think I understand under which scenarios `useLayoutEffect` should be used, and that it\'s called before the browser paints the new frame, but then when is my `useEffect` hook called? Is it always called after `useLayoutEffect`? What would happen if I replaced all my `useEffect` calls with `useLayoutEffect` calls instead?\\r\\n3. Generally hooks seem like a very good abstraction to me, but writing custom ones seems too error prone to me. I\'m pretty new to hooks overall, but I think I\'m relatively experienced as a developer, but if even writing a relatively simple one, like the `usePromise` hook I posted, has so many pitfalls to be aware of maybe this is an issue? I realize this sounds a bit like blaming the language for the bugs I\'ve introduced, but perhaps there\'s a way to make this process less error prone? i.e. new/improved linter rules, less ambiguity (`useEffect`/`useLayoutEffect`), clearer lifecycle (when is `useEffect` even called? are my components re-rendering an unexpected amount of times?), no need to update values directly (hypothetically maybe they should be proxies so that `set*` functions can update them immediately or something? I realize that proxies aren\'t polyfillable but there might be other ways around it), no need for specifying dependencies (the code might be statically analyzable at build-time most of the times).\\r\\n\\r\\nIn hindsight maybe this \\"General feedback\\" section is a bit off-topic, let me know if you guys want me to move that into a separate issue.\\r\\n\\r\\nSorry for the long issue, hopefully it\'s helpful.","created_at":"2019-07-06T21:03:26Z"},{"number":16072,"id":464818457,"title":"fix a puzzle variable name. rootSibling => rootChild.","user":{"login":"gxvv","id":8492441},"state":"closed","body":"The origin variable is temporary for storing `container.lastChild`.
