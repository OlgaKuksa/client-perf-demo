    "body": "The closest related issue I could, is somewhat of the inverse of this one: #7711\r\n\r\nReact version: 16.12 (older versions as well)\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create a component\r\n2. Add state indicating whether it is enabled or disabled (advised to start as enabled)\r\n3. On render, let the component return a `<fieldset>` with: a `<legend>` containing an `<input>` (checkbox) element, and another form element (`<select>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`).\r\n4. Add the `disabled` attribute that follows the aforementioned state to the `<fieldset>`.\r\n5. Make the `onChange` event of the `<input>` in the `<fieldset>` responsible for modifying the state of the component (enabled/disabled). \r\n6. Run an app that uses the described component.\r\n7. Disable the `<fieldset>` using the `<input>` in its `<legend>`.\r\n8. (Try to) enable the `<fieldset>`.\r\n\r\nLink to code example: [Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/wizardly-ellis-45sel?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark)\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport React from \"react\";\r\n\r\nexport default function App() {\r\n  const [enabled, setEnabled] = React.useState(true);\r\n  return <React.Fragment>\r\n    <fieldset disabled={!enabled}>\r\n      <legend>\r\n        <input \r\n          type=\"checkbox\"\r\n          checked={enabled}\r\n          onChange={(evt)=>{setEnabled(evt.target.checked);}}/>\r\n      </legend>\r\n      <textarea></textarea>\r\n    </fieldset>\r\n    <p>\r\n      Disable the above fieldset by unchecking the checkbox. Checking the box once again does not re-enable the fieldset however.\r\n    </p>\r\n  </React.Fragment>;\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\nEnabling the `<fieldset>` using the `<input>` in its `<legend>` changes the state of the `<input>` in unchecked fashion; it does not fire its `onChange` event and its value does thus no longer match the state of the component.\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\nBased on the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/html/wiki/Elements/fieldset) and [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/form-elements.html#the-fieldset-element) spec, the contents of the first `<legend>` of a `<fieldset>` should not be disabled when that fieldset is disabled. \r\n\r\nOne would expect that if an element does not appear disabled, its events will be triggered.

    "body": "When the user interacts with the UI more quickly than it can respond, you usually don't want to update the screen with anything that isn't the last thing the user requested.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you click on multiple tabs in, we should not switch to any tab that isn't the last one you clicked. The last tab navigation supersedes all the previous ones.\r\n\r\nHowever, this only applies to transitions that update the same part of the UI. For example, if you click a new tab, and in the meantime you click a drop-down menu, it doesn't matter whether the tab or the menu appears first. They are independent, parallel transitions.\r\n\r\nTo implement this behavior, we will treat transitions as **overlapping** if they share at least one state queue between them. The result of the most recent transition in an overlapping sequence is considered the **terminal** state. The rest are considered **intermediate** states. We will avoid showing intermediate states by batching them together with the terminal one.\r\n\r\nWhen there are overlapping transitions, the `isPending` states of the `useTransition` hooks that correspond to the intermediate states are turned off (unless they happen to be the same `useTransition` hook as the terminal one).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI iterated on the implementation several times. I've squashed most of the commits to reduce noise when reviewing. You can see some of the unsquashed steps in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17418. If this is too much to review in a single PR, I can split the commits back up again; however, I don't think it's worth landing in more than two steps because there are only two useful features here. Increasing the granularity would increase the risk of landing without much benefit.\r\n\r\n## Example (demo)\r\n\r\nThe example demo is a tab switcher. Pay attention to when the pending spinner disappears, and when the tab content is allowed to switch.\r\n\r\nBefore this PR: https://codesandbox.io/s/elastic-hawking-69381\r\nAfter this PR: https://codesandbox.io/s/beautiful-goldstine-u157u"

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact version: 16.12.0\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Have a `<button/>` HTML element with `onFocus` event handler defined\r\n```\r\n<button ref={btnRef} onFocus={() => console.log(\"I'm in focus\")}>Focus Target</button>\r\n```\r\n2. Have another component with `useEffect` cleanup code which will call `focus()`\r\n```\r\nReact.useEffect(() => {\r\n  const ref = btnRef.current;  // btnRef is a ref to the button component above\r\n  return () => {\r\n    console.log(\"effect cleanup \", new Date().toISOString());\r\n    ref.focus();\r\n  };\r\n}, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the cleanup code from `useEffect` is called, `onFocus` event handler of the `button` is not called. The `button` is rendered in a component which is mounted when `useEffect` cleanup executes. For example it can be in the parent component.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\r\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\r\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nLink to code example: https://codesandbox.io/s/onfocus-not-called-from-useeffect-cleanup-npw7k\r\n\r\n1. Open example in browser (tested in Chrome 79.0.3945.88 and in Firefox 72.0.1).\r\n2. Open dev console\r\n3. Click on Focus target button. See another component below it with two buttons.\r\n4. Remove focus from Focus target button by setting it in adjacent input field \r\n5. Click on Set focus button. Observe that focus is set to Focus target button and in console see message 'I'm in focus...'. This message is logged from `onFocus` event handler\r\n6. Remove focus from Focus target button.\r\n7. Click Close me button. Observe that focus is set to Focus target button but no message in console from `onFocus` event handler\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\r\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\r\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\r\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\r\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n`onFocus` is not called\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n`onFocus` is called"

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `master`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test-prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) typechecks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\nFixes #16416 . If you had a `renderToStaticMarkup` or `renderToString` inside the hook, it would cause all the hooks to finish and set `workInProgressHook` to `null`. In this PR, I am trying to call the `finishHooks` only when we're not doing a static markup. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Test Plan\r\nIts my first issue so I might have missed something. I ran `yarn test`, `yarn linc` and `yarn flow`, they are all passing. Also, I am not sure how to add a test for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Before we can land this we need that to roll out completely and flip the feature flag on by default.\r\n\r\nThis PR then updates the Renderer integration with TextInputState to handle instances instead of reactTag.\r\n\r\nIn order to make that work, we have to have an instance. Which means that components with NativeMethodsMixin and ReactNative.NativeComponent will no longer be able to call `.focus` or `.blur`. This is a breaking change but we are okay with that. For Fabric components implemented with those aren't supported anyways.\r\n\r\nThis changes the HostComponents, making them pass themselves to TextInputState.\r\n\r\nAlso added tests.\r\n\r\nFor Facebook employees: \r\nThis PR will need to land and by synced in conjunction with D19458214"

When I inspect the source of this error, it is a very well-written section of code, but I can find almost no documentation on this problem anywhere. I don't know what causes it and short of spending the next two weeks stepping through React and Next.js, I have no way of know where to start. I thought I had fixed the problem by making FontAwesome a dynamic import, but then the text next to it through the same error. I've also had classes causing errors by not resolving to the same class names on hydration as the prerendered HTML has.

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\r\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReact Developer Tools: 4.4.0 f749045a5 (1/3/2020) from chrome webstore\r\nChromium: 81.0.4024.0 snapshot\r\nUbuntu: 18.04\r\n\r\n## Steps To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Open chrome with React Developer Tools installed\r\n2. Open developer console\r\n3. In console settings (cogwheel in console's top right corner)  check \"Preserve log\" checkbox (to make sure that the log is not overwritten on navigation)\r\n4. Navigate to a React-enabled website, e.g. `https://reactjs.org`\r\n5. Navigate to a plain-text page, such as `https://reactjs.org/robots.txt`\r\n\r\n## The current behavior\r\n\r\nError is printed in console:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbackend.js:32 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'sub' of undefined\r\n    at g (backend.js:32)\r\n    at e (backend.js:8)\r\ng @ backend.js:32\r\ne @ backend.js:8\r\npostMessage (async)\r\na @ contentScript.js:1\r\n117 @ contentScript.js:1\r\nn @ contentScript.js:1\r\n(anonymous) @ contentScript.js:1\r\n(anonymous) @ contentScript.js:1\r\n\r\n```\r\nwhere `backend.js` is a link to `chrome-extension://fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi/build/backend.js`\r\n\r\n`fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi` is an ID of React Developer Tools: I verified by opening `chrome://extensions/` and performing page search for this ID.\r\n\r\n\r\n## The expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo errors\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nIt's a convoluted usecase, but I thought it may help to catch bugs for more important ones. \r\n\r\nI am not sure whether it's plain-text-ness of the page that is important, but that's how you can reproduce it.\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis is that dev tools do not expect HTML tree to disappear on navigation, or either extension enters a state where it cannot digest the plain text pages (and it probably shouldn't try).\r\n\r\n\r\n<sup>\r\nP.S. Thanks for the refreshed extension, it makes dev experience so wonderful! ❤️ \r\n</sup>"

I've found that these test id attributes closely mirror the component hierarchy. Instead of needing to declare this essentially duplicate information it would be useful if there was a utility which allowed me to programmatically retrieve a dom node that corresponds to a particular component's name for testing purposes. Ideally, this would essentially mirror the functionality of the \"inspect dom node\" feature in react dev tools.\r\n"

But if I start using hooks in this lowercase named component, React will give error `React Hook \"useState\" is called in function \"login\" which is neither a React function component or a custom React Hook function  react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nReproduce bug [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/cranky-darwin-rnh4y)\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe expected behaviour is that I should get a warning at the first point when I am creating a component which starts with lowercase and if I am using hooks into a functional component that starts with lowercase then it should give useful warning something like `start component with uppercase`.\r\n\r\nI  know as a developer that I should always start my component with Uppercase letter. But if by mistake someone creates a component with a lowercase letter and tries to use hooks, he will have no clue what is wrong with his code.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

    "body": "Note: This API is intentionally meant to be a low-level way of creating events and assigning listeners to them. It's meant to be verbose so larger building blocks can be created on top of them.\r\n\r\nThis PR is an alternative solution and system to that of my other PR: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17508. Specifically, based off feedback internally, I've tried to tackle some of the problems that were brought up with the `createListener` approach in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17508:\r\n\r\n- `createListener` largely depended on events being registered in the commit phase, meaning that there would likely be issues around needing to flush more to ensure we register DOM events. The new approach enforces all events are registered unconditionally via hooks in the render phase, mitigating this issue.\r\n- `createListener` allowed for listeners to update and change their properties between renders, which again is problematic for performance and would also require more flushes to ensure we have committed the latest version of each listener.\r\n- `createListener` had a complex diffing process to ensure we stored the latest listeners, but this meant that the process had additional overhead and memory usage – which is no longer the case with this PR.\r\n- `createListener` required listeners to be put on nodes via the `listeners` prop. Furthermore, it required using arrays to combine multiple listeners, which some felt was not idealistic and might be confusing during debugging as to which listeners occurred at which stages. Also, there was general dislike to introducing another internal prop – as it would mean we'd have to first forbid `listeners` and wait for React 17 to introduce these APIs, as they might be used in the wild for other reasons (custom elements).\r\n- `createListener` didn't provide an idiomatic way to conditionally add/remove root events (they're called delegated events in this new PR). With the new approach, there's a streamlined approach to ensure this is easier to do, and by default, no root events can be added unconditionally, which is a code-smell and a good cause of memory leaks/performance issues.\r\n\r\nTaking the above points into consideration, the design of this new event system aims at bringing the same capabilities as described in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17508 whilst also providing some other nice features, that should allow for bigger event sub-systems to be built on top.\r\n\r\n## `ReactDOM.useEvent`\r\n\r\nThis hook allows for the registration to a native DOM event, similar to that of `addEventListener` on the web. `useEvent` takes a given event `type` and registers it to the DOM then returns an object unique to that event that allows listeners to be attached to their targets in an effect or another event handler. The object provides three different methods to setup and handle listeners:\r\n\r\n- `setListener(target: window | element, listener: ?(Event => void))` set a listener to be active for a given DOM node. The node must be a DOM node managed by React or it can be the `window` node for delegation purposes. If the listener is `null` or `undefined` then we remove the given listener for that DOM node or `window` object.\r\n- `clear()` remove all listeners\r\n\r\nThe hook takes three arguments:\r\n\r\n- `type` the DOM event to listen to\r\n- `options` an optional object allowing for additional properties to be defined on the event listener. The options are:\r\n  - `passive` provide an optional flag that tells the listener to register a passive DOM event listener or an active DOM event listener\r\n  - `capture` provide an optional flag that tells the listener callback to fire in the capture phase or the bubble phase\r\n  - `priority` provide an optional Scheduler priority that allows React to correct schedule the listener callback to fire at the correct priority.\r\n\r\n## Note\r\n\r\nFor propagation, the same rules of `stopPropagation` and `stopImmediatePropagation` apply to these event listeners. These methods are actually monkey-patched, as we use the actual native DOM events with this system and API, rather than Synthetic Events. `currentTarget` and `eventPhase` are also respectfully monkey-patched to co-ordinate and align with the propagation system involved internally within React.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, all event listeners are passive by default. If is desired to called `event.preventDefault` on an event listener, then the event listener should be made active via the `passive` option.\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\n\r\nAn example of a basic clickable button:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport {useRef, useEffect} from 'react';\r\nimport {useEvent} from 'react-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction Button({children, onClick}) {\r\n  const buttonRef = useRef(null);\r\n  const clickEvent = useEvent('click');\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    clickEvent.setListener(buttonRef.current, onClick);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return <button ref={buttonRef}>{children}</button>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to listen to events that are delegated to the window, you can do that:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport {useRef, useEffect} from 'react';\r\nimport {useEvent} from 'react-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction Button({children, onClick}) {\r\n  const clickEvent = useEvent('click');\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    // Pass in `window`, which is supported with this API\r\n    // Note: `window` is not supported, as React doesn't\r\n    // listen to events that high up.\r\n    clickEvent.setListener(window, onClick);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return <button>{children}</button>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to extract the verbosity out of this into a custom hook, then it's possible to do so:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport {useRef, useEffect} from 'react';\r\nimport {useEvent} from 'react-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction useClick(ref, onClick) {\r\n  const clickEvent = useEvent('click');\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    clickEvent.setListener(ref.current, onClick);\r\n  });\r\n\r\n  return buttonRef;\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Button({children}) {\r\n  const buttonRef = useRef(null);\r\n  useClick(buttonRef , () => {\r\n    console.log('Hello world!')\r\n  });\r\n  return <button ref={buttonRef}>{children}</button>;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nA more complex button that tracks when the button is being pressed with the mouse:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport {useRef, useEffect} from 'react';\r\nimport {useEvent} from 'react-dom';\r\n\r\nfunction Button({children, onClick}) {\r\n  const buttonRef = useRef(null);\r\n  const [pressed, setPressed] = useState(false);\r\n  const click = useEvent('click');\r\n  const mouseUp = useEvent('mouseup');\r\n  const mouseDown = useEvent('mousedown');\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const button = buttonRef.current;\r\n\r\n    const handleMouseUp = () => {\r\n      setPressed(false);\r\n    };\r\n    const handleMouseDown = () => {\r\n      setPressed(true); \r\n    };\r\n\r\n    click.setListener(button, onClick);\r\n    if (pressed) {\r\n      mouseUp.setListener(button, handleMouseUp);\r\n    } else {\r\n      mouseDown.setListener(button, handleMouseDown);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return () => {\r\n      click.setListener(button, null);\r\n      mouseDown.setListener(button, null);\r\n      mouseUp.setListener(button, null);\r\n    };\r\n  }, [pressed, onClick]);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <button ref={buttonRef} className={pressed && 'pressed'}>\r\n      {children}\r\n    </button>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What about the DOM's `element.addEventListener`?\r\n\r\nIn many respects, this low-level API was intentionally designed to be a replacement for the DOM's `addEventListener`. Not only does this new Listener API provide many nice benefits, like auto-recycling listeners on unmount, but it should also help prevent bugs that will likely occur when `addEventListener` is used in conjunction with Concurrent Mode.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed list of differences, here are just some of the key benefits of the Listener API vs the DOM's `addEventListener`:\r\n\r\n- The event listeners automatically get recycled upon unmount\r\n- The event listeners correctly batch updates and flush previous ones correctly, as well as co-ordinating priority levels with the internal scheduler\r\n- The event listeners allow for alignment with the propagation of other events in the React event system, something not possible with manual DOM event listeners\r\n- The event listeners will correctly work with React Portals, Suspense and Concurrent Mode, native event listeners do not.\r\n- By ensuring we use a hook, like useEvent, we can determine the event needed during server-side render and ensure those events are registered on initial hydration ahead of time. This makes it possible to \"replay\" those events before the components themselves have concurrently hydrated on the client."

    "body": "A challenge with the React DevTools profiler is that it's too hard to correlate profiler results with console logs. This makes diagnosing and fixing render performance issues much more difficult.\r\n\r\nFor example, yesterday I was debugging an app where each render usually took 10ms-20ms except every 20-30 renders it'd take 600-800ms.  It was frustrating that I didn't have a way to correlate the profiler UI (which told me which renders were problematic) with the verbose console log output that might tell me exactly what went wrong during those renders. Instead I had to comb through logs and guess which output came from \"bad\" renders. This was tedious and error-prone.\r\n\r\nAnyway, my proposal is for React DevTools to make it easy to correlate profiler results with console log output.  Both directions would be useful:\r\n1) **navigate from logs to profiler** - if I see a suspicious line in the logs, I'd like to easily navigate to the profiler with the specific component/commit selected that was running when the line was logged.\r\n2) **navigate from profiler to logs** - if I see a suspiciously long commit, I'd like to select it in the profiler pane and have an easy way to see associated logs.\r\n\r\nI don't have a strong opinion about how this should be accomplished, but below are a few ideas to spur discussion.\r\n\r\nA minimal solution could be something like this: \r\na) The profiler assigns a unique ID to each commit\r\nb) The profiler's right pane would show the ID for each commit\r\nc) React would add a new hook that'd return that ID\r\nd) Userland code could include the ID in logs.\r\n\r\nJust this minimal support would be a vast improvement.\r\n\r\nIf we wanted to make it smoother, here's a few ideas that could be layered on top.\r\n\r\n1. **Profiler->Console Links** The ID in the profiler UI could be a hyperlink that'd open the console drawer and put the ID in the console's CMD+F search box. This would be one-click navigation from profiler to logs. I don't know if Chrome allows this kind of cross-pane control, over the console UI so this might not be practical.\r\n\r\n2. **Console -> Profiler Links**  For one-click logging in the other direction., we could have a special URL format (e.g. `react://profiler/commit/2c1056b5-1be1-43d4-a105-1d840cf4f9c3`) that would enable userland code to emit links in the console that, when clicked, would navigate to the specific commit (in the profile pane) that was active when the logs were emitted. Similar caveat as above: I'm not sure if chrome extensions can be \"deeplinked\" like this. \r\n\r\n3. **Log Components Where** Building on (1) and (2) above, we could enable console<->profiler linking without requiring changes to userland code. We could have a profiler setting (e.g. \"log components where\" with UX like \"hide components where\") that, when active, would emit a line to the console log at the start of each render of a matching component. The output would link back to the profiler, e.g. \r\n`[RDT] Starting MyCoolComponent (react://profiler/commit/2c1056b51be143d4a1051d840cf4f9c3)`.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I'm unfamiliar with React and RDT internals so there might be much better ways to solve log<->profiler correlation than my naive ideas above. But at least I wanted to call out the problem and encourage discussion about a solution.\r\n"

I would have expected React not to add the `value` attribute to a checkbox if `value={undefined}`. This would allow the checkbox to follow the default browser behavior.\r\n\r\nI stumbled upon this after [adding an optional `value` prop to Thumbtack's `Checkbox` React component](https://github.com/thumbtack/thumbprint/pull/502). The seemingly backwards compatible PR broke at least one sever endpoint that was checking for the \"truthyness\" of the checkbox value. Before the PR, the checkbox value defaulted to `on`. After the PR, it became `\"\"`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis should affect all browsers and OS's. I'm not sure which version of React this was introduced it, but it doesn't seem to be a recent regression. (Happy to dig in more here if needed.)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI think this happens because `ReactDOMInput.js` sets `node._wrapperState.initialValue` to `\"\"` if the `value` prop is `undefined`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/12c000412d05c4a6079b4f57f721a40b8cea374d/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOMInput.js#L114-L122\r\n\r\nPerhaps there should be a check here for `props.type` so that `defaultValue` remains `undefined` for checkboxes? I'd be happy to submit a PR if this is a bug. Thanks!"

Create a Customer Hook \r\n```javascript\r\nimport { useContext } from \"react\";\r\nimport { SomeContext } from \"src/SomeContext\";\r\n\r\nexport const useCustomHook = () => {\r\n  const {\r\n    state: { deal }\r\n  } = useContext(SomeContext);\r\n\r\n\r\nconst[contextVal, setContextVal] = useState(\"\")\r\n\r\nuseEffect ( () => {  setContextVal( get(deal, \"saleVehicle.pricing\", {});) },[ deal])\r\n  return contextVal;\r\n};\r\n\r\nuseCustomHook.defaultProps = {\r\n  deal: {},\r\n  DealContext: {}\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. now Consume this hook into your component\r\n\r\n```javascript \r\nimport {useCustomHook} from \"...relative path\"\r\n\r\nconst salePrice = ({\r\n  SomeContext: {\r\n    state: { deal, shadowState },\r\n  }\r\n}) => {\r\n//some handlers  - assume it working :D \r\n const handleFocus = event => event.target.select();\r\n  const handleOnBlur = ()=> { some call backs}\r\n  });\r\n  const handleOnChange = (ev, value) =>\r\n    updateDeal(dispatch)({ target: { name: \"salePrice\", value } });\r\n\r\nuseEffect ( () => { useCustomHook(),[deal.id])\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <TextField\r\n      value={deal.salePrice || vehSalePrice()}\r\n      fullWidth\r\n      onChange={handleOnChange}\r\n      onBlur={handleOnBlur}\r\n      disabled={hasOpenModal}\r\n      quickEntry={quickEntryEnabled}\r\n      decimalDigits={2}\r\n      onFocus={handleFocus}\r\n    />\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nsalePrice.propTypes = {\r\n  DealContext: DealContextShape.isRequired,\r\n};\r\n\r\nsalePrice.defaultProps = {\r\n\r\n  deal: { price: \"\", Vehicle: { retailPrice: \"\" } },\r\n  retailPrice: \"\"\r\n};\r\n\r\n```\r\n3 - Once `<SalePrice / >` starts executing , It looks for the Hook `useCustomHook` but then `useCustomHook` internally calls another hooks `useContext, useState, useEffect` and while executing those hooks , it does not queue them up and screen blows up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDescribe what you expected to happen:\r\n- React should handle the queue of hooks within and execute them as callStack does.\r\n\r\n\r\n![](https://files.slack.com/files-pri/TJZUB1VM1-FR3UR5HSP/image.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "Introduces React.unstable_avoidThisRender(). \r\n\r\nThis is one step towards implementing first class suspending behaviour for static resources like images/stylesheets. \r\n\r\nOne of the problems with doing this naively in \"userland\", is because React is so aggressive on rerendering when the thenables resolve, we end up doing a bunch of unneeded rerenders. This sequence of PRs is to optimize the paths React executes in such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it's implemented\r\n---\r\n\r\n(There might be errors/a lack of understanding in this description)\r\n\r\n`unstable_avoidThisRender()` is called during the render phase, which is similar to the 'throw' phase (without the actual throwing). When this happens:\r\n- we look for the nearest Suspense boundary (that satisfies hasInvisibleParentBoundary === true), \r\n- and mark it's `effectTag` as `SoftCapture` (which is a variant of `DidCapture` for avoided renders). \r\n- We also attach a ping listener for cleaning up if the thenable resolves before we commit that boundary.\r\n\r\n(These steps are similar to what we'd call if you threw an actual promise; ie - `throwException()`)\r\n\r\nSoon after this, `completeWork` is called for the marked Suspense boundary. We use this instant to mark the boundary as expired, and return itself to render itself again.\r\n\r\nSoon after, beginWork is called for that boundary. `SoftCapture` tells us that boundary has suspended. We clear the effectTag, initialize suspenseState/memoizedState on that boundary, and set `expirationTime` and `memoizedState.didAvoidRenderTime` as `renderExpirationTime - 1`; ie - we mark that boundary as 'expiring very soon'. \r\n\r\nSoon `unstable_avoidThisRender()` is called again, setting the effectTag back to `SoftCapture`. (This time in completeWork, we see that the effectTag and memoizedState are set, so can bypass returning itself.) \r\n\r\nAfter committing, the content rerender happens. (???) \r\n\r\nThis time, in `completeWork()`, we call `renderDidSuspendDelayIfPossible()` to set the exit status on the tree. Currently, the actual content gets committed.\r\n\r\nThat's ...it? In the next PR, we'll add a new exitStatus, and actually show the fallback, passing the commented out tests in `ReactSuspenseWithNoopRenderer-test.internal.js`\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO: address this review comment https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17556/files#r358883141"

    "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\nIn React Native, we're working on a new RedBox experience for errors and warnings called LogBox. In LogBox, we separate out component stack traces and show them similar to call stacks.\r\n\r\nWe'd like to be able to tap on these components and open them (like we can with call stacks).\r\n\r\n## Solutions\r\nIn React we have the full file path context, but when we build the component stack trace, we strip the full path so that it displays only the file name.\r\n\r\nThere are two options to achieve this:\r\n- For React Native, don't strip the full path [here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/b438699d3620bff236282b049204e1221b3689e9/packages/react-devtools-shared/src/backend/describeComponentFrame.js#L25). This will result in longer component stack messages with every frame having the full path.\r\n- Keep the message the same, and instead add structured component stack frame info including the full file path."

    "body": "Currently behaviour of `useEffect` hook is defined by the last parameter. It is either not defined at all, empty array, or enumerates the values.\r\n\r\nI believe this adds a bit of cognitive load to the developer. The intention is not clear until I look at the end of the function. Second, the difference between empty array `[]` and not defined array is not that drastic. Furthermore, natural flow is like that: define values, and when any of them changes, then apply effect, so I assume specifying the list of tracked values first is better.\r\n\r\nI personally think, it would be nice to have something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport {useEffect} from \"react\";\r\n\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Applies effect on every render of the component.\r\n *\r\n * @param {React.EffectCallback} effect - Imperative function that can return a cleanup function.\r\n */\r\nfunction useEffectAlways(effect){\r\n    useEffect(effect);\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Applies effect only if one of the values of deps array changes.\r\n *\r\n * @param {any[]} deps - Array of values which are tracked by React to determine whether effect should be applied.\r\n * @param {React.EffectCallback} effect - Imperative function that can return a cleanup function.\r\n */\r\n/* \r\nDECISION: deps intentionally goes first, because it resembles the flow: if 'deps' changed then apply 'effect'.\r\nand it is much easier to spot the list of dependencies, when it goes first.\r\nCompare:\r\nuseEffectOnChanges([a, b, c], () => {\r\n ...\r\n ...\r\n ...\r\n});\r\nand\r\nuseEffectOnChanges(() => {\r\n  ...\r\n  ...\r\n  ...\r\n}, [a, d, c]); \r\n*/\r\n function useEffectOnChanges(deps, effect){\r\n    if (!deps || deps.length === 0){\r\n        throw new Error(\"Either provide non empty deps array or call useEffectAlways/useEffectOnce.\");\r\n    }\r\n    useEffect(effect, deps);\r\n}\r\n\r\n// defining a constant for empty array allows us to avoid memory allocation on every call.\r\nconst __emptyArray = [];\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * Applies effect only once on the first render of the component. Equivalent to componentDidMount lifecycle method.\r\n *\r\n * @param {React.EffectCallback} effect - Imperative function that can return a cleanup function.\r\n */\r\nfunction useEffectOnce(effect){\r\n    useEffect(effect, __emptyArray);\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport { useEffectAlways, useEffectOnChanges, useEffectOnce }; \r\n```\r\n"

Render:\r\n```jsx\r\nrender(\r\n  <SuspenseList revealOrder=\"forwards\">\r\n    <Suspense fallback={<span>Loading B</span>}>\r\n      <B />\r\n    </Suspense>\r\n    <Suspense fallback={<span>Loading C</span>}>\r\n      <C />\r\n    </Suspense>\r\n  </SupenseList>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Resolve `B` and `C`\r\n\r\n3. (Re-)render:\r\n```jsx\r\nrender(\r\n  <SuspenseList revealOrder=\"forwards\">\r\n    <Suspense fallback={<span>Loading A</span>}>\r\n      <A />\r\n    </Suspense>\r\n    <Suspense fallback={<span>Loading C</span>}>\r\n      <C />\r\n    </Suspense>\r\n    <Suspense fallback={<span>Loading C</span>}>\r\n      <C />\r\n    </Suspense>\r\n  </SupenseList>\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Output is: `Loading A / C / Loading C`\r\n\r\nWith:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n// You can considerer the following:\r\nconst A = React.lazy(() => import('./A'));\r\nconst B = React.lazy(() => import('./B'));\r\nconst C = React.lazy(() => import('./C'));\r\n```\r\nIn my code: https://github.com/dubzzz/react-suspenselist-bug/blob/master/src/App.js#L189_L205\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'd have expected to have either `Loading A / Loading C / Loading C` or `Loading A / C / C`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact: `master` branch\r\nReact: `0.0.0-experimental-b53ea6ca0`\r\n\r\n**How did I found this bug?**\r\n\r\nThis _potential bug_ has been discovered while I was trying to run property based tests based on [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check/) against React library.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dubzzz/react/commit/79d49ed85c34a5339f1d3163a0c6e99eddaf4405\r\n\r\nIn my test I was assessing the following properties:\r\n- `\"together\"`: only renders when all components are ready (test covers complex and deep structures containing nested `<SuspenseList revealOrder=\"together\" />` and `<Suspense />` referencing potentially multiple times the same `Component`)\r\n- `\"forwards\"`: only renders components up to the last resolved one, all components after this one will be considered as unresolved"

    "body": "This came up in a [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/devongovett/status/1199862177559171072?s=21) with @gaearon and @aweary and we decided to move the discussion here. I’ll try to summarize the conversation so far below.\n\nThe basic question was whether a build tool could extract the static parts of a component tree ahead of time into HTML, and ship smaller JS to the client with only the dynamic parts. This could have benefits for code size and hydration performance for statically generated sites. It would likely have a smaller impact on dynamically generated server rendered sites, but it’s possible there are static parts that could be extracted there too (e.g. header, footer, article content, etc.).\n\nThere are a couple potential ways to go about this, each with various tradeoffs.\n\n1. Do something like what ember and other template compilers do and generate some kind of IR from components and inject dynamic content into slots at runtime. This would likely require a lot of changes to React itself. @aweary seems to be working on some kind of [compiler](https://twitter.com/aweary/status/1199867044532903937?s=21) to do just that.\n2. Rewrite the JS with something like prepack, similar to what @trueadm did [here](https://github.com/trueadm/ssr-with-prepack-hackathon) (though it sounded like the output was quite variable in size).\n3. Rewrite the component tree to generate a different but equivalent tree with the static parts hoisted out. Similar to this [babel plugin](https://github.com/jamiebuilds/babel-react-optimize) but taken much farther to work at a whole tree level instead of a component level. Also to remove the static parts from JS altogether and generate static HTML to avoid duplicate content in JS and unnecessary hydration cost. Some way to allow static HTML in the middle of a tree to be reused might be needed, but maybe compiling to multiple roots would work?\n\nObviously a lot more thought is needed here. As @gaearon noted, a solid definition of “static” will be important for this discussion. Mine is that it could be rendered to HTML and never updated by JS, but perhaps people have other ideas."

    "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nAsk a question\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nWith `Suspense`, a component throws a `Promise` when it encounters something that's not ready. However, our company's data fetching is subscription-oriented: At a very high level, the following happens:\r\n\r\n1. Component renders, and calls `useFoo(id, 'name', 'amount', 'discounts');`\r\n2. Internally, the hook adds a callback to the `FooLoader` which is responsible for batching and sending async requests. The callback will invoke the setter for a `useState` inside the hook to force a rerender of the consuming component. \r\n3. The hook returns a [`RemoteData<Pick<Foo, 'name' | 'amount' | 'discounts'>>`](https://github.com/ExtraHop/ts-remote-data) which could contain the data if it was locally available, or is just a constant that says, \"I haven't asked for this data yet\"\r\n4. When the data becomes available, or the request for the data fails, the `FooLoader` invokes the hook-passed-in callback method, which triggers the rerender, which presents the new component state.\r\n\r\nAt no point in there does the component have a `Promise`. As a result, I'm not sure it's possible for it to throw anything; it's depending on the `useState` inside `useFoo` to trigger rerender when data is available, but if we throw then that never happens and we wouldn't ever complete.\r\n\r\nThrowing a `Promise` from inside the hook doesn't seem right, as it would be very difficult to combine multiple data dependencies in a single component.\r\n\r\nThe only alternative seems to be a pretty sizable plumbing change to return a `Promise` instead of the loading state constant, but that seems to force a lot of allocations and boilerplate code to handle the \"maybe not ready the first time\" case.\r\n\r\nNote: Posting in response to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1194434908984414208) by @gaearon "

    "body": "## Overview\r\nContinuation on #13321.  This PR adds ESM outputs to most libraries - excluding reconciler, devtools, and react-native libraries. There's still some more work to be done WRT verifying the ESM output, but I think it's at a point where it's ready for comments to see if it's worth pursuing further.\r\n\r\n#### TODO\r\n- [x] CI: test-package-structure script should run on build\r\n    - [x] Note: this needs NodeJS 13.2+ - a Github action workflow has been added for this check in the meantime - [sample output here](https://github.com/darthtrevino/react/commit/9df712532d6cb28f2affee1ebd8ff1f6249a358c/checks?check_suite_id=336225429).\r\n- [x] restore legacy-mode support for fb builds. (added custom babel-transformer from #13356)\r\n- [x] esm dependencies\r\n    - [x] scheduler subpath imports for mjs\r\n    - [x] When [prop-types](https://github.com/facebook/prop-types) is esm, the following packages can add esm builds. However, prop-types cannot be updated for esm support until `react-is` is published with esm support, which is part of this PR..\r\n         * react\r\n         * react-dom\r\n         * react-debug-tools\r\n         * create-subscription\r\n         * use-subscription\r\n         * react-cache\r\n- [x] verify esm output is importable (check-packages script, with `--experimental-conditional-exports` flag)\r\n- [x] make the package.json structures actually align to dual-package spec and not the de-facto \"module\" field\r\n- [x] minify esm production (note - used terser until we can get closure compiler working on ESM)\r\n- [x] verify bundle structures (e.g. packages that declare a main or module script actually have those scripts present).\r\n- [x] pkgs with no index.js, should have no index.mjs\r\n- [x] pkgs with named exports have no exports in index.mjs\r\n- [x] esm reconciler packages? (skip for now)\r\n- [x] add `module` fields to packages\r\n\r\n## Artifacts\r\nBundles may be configured with the additional build targets `ESM_DEV` and `ESM_PROD`. The build output will generate the following files:\r\n```\r\nesm/<package_name>.development.mjs\r\nesm/<package_name>.production.min.mjs\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Module Entry\r\nPackages that support ESM are structured using the [Dual CommonJS/ESModules Pattern](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v13.x/docs/api/esm.html#esm_dual_commonjs_es_module_packages) using the conditional exports feature.\r\n\r\nPackages may define an `__exports` field to support ESM. This is prefixed with a double-underscore to avoid file resolution issues with build. (e.g. import <package/src/x> will break if exports is set during build).  During build each package's __exports field is assigned into the `exports` field of the final build.\r\n\r\nPackages may also define top-level `.mjs` files in the `npm/` folders, similar to how they currently include top-level `index.js` files. These can be used to define the modular API.\r\n\r\n```json5\r\n{\r\n   \"name\": \"react-x\",\r\n   \"version\": \"16.derp\",\r\n   \"main\": \"index.js\",\r\n  // will be turned into \"exports\" in build step\r\n   \"__exports\": { \r\n     // top-level import is under \".\"\r\n      \".\": {\r\n         // Note: relative imports are important here\r\n         \"require\": \"./index.js\",\r\n         \"default\": \"./index.mjs\"\r\n      },\r\n      \"./subpath_import\": {\r\n         \"require: \"./subpath_import.js\",\r\n         \"require: \"./subpath_import.mjs\",\r\n      }\r\n   }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Verification\r\nModule structure is verified with a new script: test-package-structure, which is performed after the packages are built. This script depends on NodeJS >= 13.2 with the`--experimantal-conditional-exports` flag. The goal of this script is to ensure that packages are aligned with future NodeJS specifications for ES Modules. This script verifies the following invariants over each built package:\r\n\r\n* If `main` field is present in package.json, the file it references exists.\r\n* If an `exports` specification exists in package.json, the files it references exist.\r\n* The entries in `files` for each package.json exist.\r\n* The package can be included with a `require` statement\r\n* Each entry in `exports` can be included with `require()` and `import()`\r\n\r\nSample Output:\r\nsample package validator output:\r\n\r\n```\r\n📦 create-subscription\r\n\t✓ pkg.main file exists\r\n\t✓ pkg.files@[LICENSE]

The wrapper would just return the last value in that case.\r\n\r\nI know I could just `useMemo` everywhere but sometimes having to provide default values or adding extra conditionals for some edge cases adds some noise to the code.\r\n\r\nIs there any reason against this method?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

The work I do or have pretty much always done in React involves dealing with streams of data, generally coming over a web socket. What will it look like? Will it be easy for users to implement/use? Is a promise/thenable an appropriate type for dealing with this even internally, given that the first value may never show up?\r\n\r\n### Desire\r\n\r\nThe ability to leverage suspense to \"suspend\" until the first of many values arrives from a stream of data coming from any source. For the sake of conversation, we'll say a web socket.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Constraints\r\n\r\n- The first value may never arrive\r\n- The source may close without error, having never provided a value\r\n- There must be an ergonomic teardown mechanism, for example how developers can currently teardown in the returned function of `useEffect` or in `componentWillUnmount`.\r\n- There may be more than one value returned by the streaming source\r\n\r\n### Optional constraints\r\n\r\n- The first N values form the source may be synchronous (followed by asynchronous values)\r\n\r\n### Scenario\r\n\r\nA simple app with two routes, one where the app needs to open a web socket connection and collect streaming data, and the other where the socket connection should be closed. The values from the web socket may take long enough that the developer will want to move to that routed component right away and show some spinner with suspense until the first bit of data arrives. If the user navigates to the first route, then leaves before the first value arrives, what happens?\r\n\r\nMy concern is, that if, even internally, the mechanism is a promise or thenable, there is a chance leaks will be created in the event that the source of that first value is torn down before the first value arrives. The only way, with a thenable or promise, to avoid that chance would be to make sure that the teardown mechanism was somehow tied to the thenable, so that the thenable to be rejected (or resolved) with a known value, such that it will be \"settled\"."

But I think that this should be fixed before it's stable.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\n![Screen Recording 2019-11-21 at 12 39 56 PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1500684/69371223-a6039a80-0c5c-11ea-9fd4-848a3f1672fa.gif)\r\n\r\nNote the 1000ms at the bottom (which should show last based on the `revealOrder`) shows at 2000ms for the nested version.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between those two sets of SuspenseLists is that one has nested the two bottom suspense elements in a `div`. Something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfunction App() {\r\n  return (\r\n    <SuspenseList revealOrder=\"forwards\">\r\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>2000ms loading</div>}>\r\n        <A />\r\n      </Suspense>\r\n      <div> {/* nesting */}\r\n        <Suspense fallback={<div>3000ms loading</div>}>\r\n          <B />\r\n        </Suspense>\r\n        <Suspense fallback={<div>1000ms loading</div>}>\r\n          <C />\r\n        </Suspense>\r\n      </div> {/* nesting */}\r\n    </SuspenseList>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/suspenselist-issues-sdqzb\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI would expect them to behave exactly the same. Nesting things is often necessary for styling reasons.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI'm experiencing this on `react@0.0.0-experimental-b53ea6ca0` and `react-dom@0.0.0-experimental-b53ea6ca0`. I don't believe this ever worked in previous versions of React."

    "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nSuspense is still experimental, so it's neither 🙃\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt's best described via a code example in this codesandbox: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-suspenselist-problem-8g7c1\r\n\r\nHere's a summary:\r\n\r\nWhen \"forwards\" is used for the `revealOrder` of a SuspenseList, React does not even try to render components in suspense boundaries after the most \"forward\" suspense boundary. This should be fine, but it can be a problem when used with React.lazy because the dynamic import isn't started until the lazy component is rendered so adding a SuspenseList to an existing set of lazily loaded components results in a slower overall loading experience thanks to a waterfall effect.\r\n\r\nFor completeness I'll just add that this same thing applies to \"backwards\" as an option as well.\r\n\r\nI understand why SuspenseList doesn't bother rendering components in Suspense Boundaries until they're ready to be shown. It's because we should be firing requests for things before we try to render the components that need those resources. However, React.lazy is a bit of a special case because it doesn't suspend until it's rendered the first time and for the developer to fire that request eagerly requires extra work on the part of the developer (there's a comment in the code showing the workaround).\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nBecause React.lazy is a special case and people are likely to run into this gotcha a lot when implementing Suspense Lists around lazy components, I think something should be done for these to start loading the module eagerly without workarounds. I'm not sure what to suggest to do about it though.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nVersion `0.0.0-experimental-b53ea6ca0` and I don't think this ever worked in a previous version."

In the example, we change Page1 and Page2 to soft components. Thus solve the problem I shown above."

For the full example, see my codesandbox below.\r\n\r\nIn the codesandbox, if you change the value of the input, the new value is provided to the context which causes the hook used in `MemoizedChild` (`useValue`) to throw a promise. This flips `Suspense` to the fallback state and when the promise resolves `MemoizedChild`'s state is not updated with the proper context value because (I'm assuming) the memoized value of `MemoizedChild` is the one that contained the previous context value and technically no props have changed, so that makes sense why it wouldn't have updated. However, this seems like it would be unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-suspense-maybe-bug-sznbk\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI would expect that `MemoizedChild` would be re-rendered with the new provided value.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

Thank you for everything you are doing!\r\n\r\nRegarding the `Suspense` component, could it be nice to have a property (both in Concurrent Mode and in \"normal/synchronous\" mode) which would allow us to set the minimum duration of the `Suspense` fallback UI in case the fallback UI ever gets rendered?\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nLet me do an example. Try clicking on the `Next` button in this codesandbox: \r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/cold-monad-ifr29.\r\n\r\nYou will see that the `Suspense` fallback UI is rendered and stays in the tree just for a little moment (`~200ms`) because both promises resolve in `1200ms`, while `useTransition` has a `timeoutMs` of 1 second.\r\nIn my opinion, this is a bit unpleasant to the eye.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be nicer if we could tell the `Suspense` component something like \"If you ever render the fallback, show it for at least N millisec.\"? E.g.:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n...\r\nfunction ProfilePage({ resource }) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading profile...</h1>}\r\n      // If the fallback ever gets rendered,\r\n      // it will be shown for at least 1500 millisec.,\r\n      // even if the promise resolves right after rendering the fallback.\r\n      fallbackMinDurationMs={1500}>\r\n      <ProfileDetails resource={resource} />\r\n      <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading posts...</h1>}>\r\n        <ProfileTimeline resource={resource} />\r\n      </Suspense>\r\n    </Suspense>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsider an animated spinner used as a fallback of `Suspense`, if it happens that the promise resolves just a few milliseconds after rendering the fallback like above, the spinner will be rendered and suddenly disappear, without completing its animation cycle and showing an incomplete animation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, if we could keep the spinner in the tree for at least `fallbackMinDurationMs` millisec. once rendered, we could improve its appearance in such cases.\r\n\r\nThe `Suspense` component responsible for rendering the fallback would have to wrap the caught Promise in a promise which would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction maxDelayFallbackPromise({\r\n  promise,\r\n  timeoutMs, // ---> This would be the value of `useTransition`'s `timeoutMs`\r\n  onFallback = () => {}, // ---> This code would run in case `timeoutMs` exceeds (i.e. when `Suspense`'s fallback UI is rendered)\r\n  fallbackMinDurationMs\r\n} = {}) {\r\n  // Generate a unique identifier, like a string, a number, in order to identify which promise resolves first...\r\n  const uniqueIdentifier = `promise_value_${Math.random()}`\r\n  return Promise.race([\r\n    promise,\r\n    timeout(timeoutMs).then(() => uniqueIdentifier)\r\n  ]).then(value => {\r\n    if (value === uniqueIdentifier) {\r\n      onFallback()\r\n      return minDelayPromise(promise, fallbackMinDurationMs)\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n      return value\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `timeout` and `minDelayPromise` are:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction timeout(delayMs) {\r\n  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delayMs))\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction minDelayPromise(promise, minDelay) {\r\n  return Promise.all([\r\n    promise,\r\n    timeout(minDelay)\r\n  ]).then(([value]) => {\r\n    return value\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could also apply to the `isPending` flag of `useTransition`...\r\n\r\nDo you think such a feature could improve the UX in such cases?\r\n"

So we aren't going to be very good stewards of its API going forward.\r\n\r\nMy proposal was for Enzyme or folks interested in it to copy the code into another repo, and continue maintaining it there under a difference package name. It would make sense to Enzyme to start depending on that fork. We would then deprecate `react-test-renderer/shallow` in favor of the community-maintained fork.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to volunteer to set up a repo, please let us know in this issue!\r\n\r\ncc @davidmarkclements regarding the proposed `react-shallow-renderer` package name."

By that I mean that I could type in for example \"Editor\" in the search box, and only components with `Editor` in their name (eg. `<Editor />`, `<MyEditor />`, etc.) would show up.\r\n\r\nIt would show the matching components, and have the option to expand them (or be pre-expanded), so it shows the components and their children.\r\n\r\nFor example, right now when loading the page, I see this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/311752/68510359-54611600-0241-11ea-978e-59d5959031d2.png)\r\n\r\nWhich is a lot of extra stuff in the components tree that I don't care about. What I'd really love to see is this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/311752/68510403-7195e480-0241-11ea-80b6-fed5de08b6b1.png)\r\n\r\nA specific child component that I'm currently interested in.\r\n\r\nIf the search box actually **filtered**, and if it was persistent across reloads, I could type \"Editor\" and then continually refresh the page and keep the specific component I care about visible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlternatively, maybe double-clicking that `<Editor>` component could show the whole tree underneath it in the detail view. Right now it just shows:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/311752/68510549-d7826c00-0241-11ea-9b4b-d9afd521869a.png)\r\n\r\nWhich is a bit of a lost opportunity.\r\n\r\nIf it showed the full tree of descendants, and if my \"selection\" was persistent across refreshes, this could solve the same use case in a different way.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if there was a way to specify _multiple_ filters, you could actually solve for the use case in https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/16478 by letting people add multiple filters to ease jumping between two components.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMaybe there's a better way that already solves this? I'd love to hear it!"

This is done outside of the React event handler (ie: via `window.addEventLIstener` and so the updates are not batched together. The update to render the numbers is artificially slowed down. \r\n\r\nIf you click the \"Increment Remote Count\" button multiple times, the update works as expected. \r\n\r\nIf you interrupt the update, via clicking the \"increment local count\", only the last number will update. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the Steps to reproduce look like: \r\n1. Click the \"Increment Remote Count\" button once\r\n2. Before the update is committed to the DOM, click the \"Increment Local Count\" update. \r\n3.

If we could somehow have the fallback component receive some kind of state from Suspense on when it is mounting and unmounting the fallback component, that would be great.\r\n"

This prevents it from invalidating downstream memoizations, like `useCallback`.\r\n\r\nWe do use `useCallback` internally so that a new `startTransition` is only created when the config object changes. However, if you pass an object, this does nothing because the object different every time.\r\n\r\nPotential fixes:\r\n\r\n- Instead of detecting changes in the config object, compare the fields (`timeoutMs` et al) directly. This fixes the worst case (inline config object) but still means we'll occasionally re-create `startTransition` functions.\r\n- Track the current config object on an internal mutable field using an effect and read from that instead of binding a new method each time. This requires extra work in the commit phase, but combined with the previous option (comparing the fields instead of the entire config object) that should be rare.\r\n- Instead of passing the config object to the `useTransition` hook, pass it to the `startTransition` function. This avoids needing to bind the config object to the method. Slightly less ergonomic, however, we're planning to change the default config object so that it's not needed in most cases. So it's only in special cases that you'd actually use one. **This is the most likely option**."

      "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nBoth/neither?\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nCurrently, react-refresh marks each component whose `type` and/or `signature` has changed as \"dirty\" and will either re-render or re-mount those components selectively.\r\n\r\nThe problem occurs when the dev tooling (webpack, parcel, etc.) loads a module that exports functions or data that are used inside of components, but aren't registered components themselves. For example, a utility function that concatenates a string:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport greet(name) {\r\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanging the returned string to `Yo, ${name}!` would trigger this module to reload in the browser, but because components which depended on it don't reload, the old greeting will persist \r\nuntil the next render of each dependent component.\r\n\r\n(BTW in actuality, some tooling will reload immediate dependents of modules that are reloaded in order to get around similar problems. You can extend the dependency chain from two to three modules, where `a.js` depends on `b.js` depends on `c.js`, and you will get the same result when editing `c.js`)\r\n\r\nWhat this forces tooling to do is apply a heuristic to try and guess whether a given module should be refreshed, vs. completely restart the app in order to cause all components to re-mount and pick up any changes that wouldn't be picked up by react-refresh.\r\n\r\nThe problems with the heuristic approach is:\r\n- each dev tool needs to implement this logic, leading to more potential for bugs\r\n- it leads to a degradation of hot reloading capabilities based on what your module exports. not obvious at all on it's face and will lead people to twisting their code base to route around this\r\n- It's very unfriendly to compile-to-JS languages like ReasonML, ClojureScript, etc. which might have different default semantics for what is public / private, different conventions for naming components, etc. which make it difficult to detect whether a module is \"safe\" to refresh\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThat components depended on newly loaded code will pick up those changes correctly, without losing state.\r\n\r\nA potential (maybe naive?) solution to this in react-refresh is, instead of only re-rendering the components marked as dirty (due to a different `type` being registered), to _re-render from the root_ while maintaining hooks state. If components' signatures have changed, then re-mount.\r\n\r\nI've read through and kind of grok most of the code in react-refresh, but I'm not sure how this would impact the way that the reconciler currently handles the HMR stuff. This is as much of a question, as it is a request: could this be a viable solution?\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and energy in reading through this. I'm very excited about having first-class support for hot reloading in React, as it's been something that I've loved ever since seeing the first demo of it. I hope that this issue can help create a way to provide a consistently excellent dev experience across tools/platforms/languages!\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.11"

      "body": "The order of returned values in useTransition is opposite to what I consider to be an established pattern of `[value, function]`.\r\n\r\nCurrent: `const [startTransition, isPending] = useTransition()`.\r\nExpected: `const [isPending, startTransition] = useTransition()`.\r\nAlso fine: `const { startTransition, isPending } = useTransition()`.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nThe order is in my opinion inconsistent with other hooks, built-in and community hooks, and this inconsistency is somewhat bothersome on the aesthetic level.\r\n\r\nUsers without tooling support (TypeScript et al) will see `Uncaught TypeError: startTransition is not a function` error whenever they get the order wrong.\r\n\r\nHaving this insonsistency risks reducing the strength of the convention in the community, making hooks less convenient to use overall.\r\n\r\n## Built-in hooks\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst [state, setState] = useState();\r\nconst [state, dispatch] = useReducer();\r\nconst [startTransition, isPending] = useTransition();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Community examples\r\n\r\nI have done a quick overview of positional returned values from hooks in the community. Hooks that use `[value, function]` pattern:\r\n\r\n[useImmer](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer#useimmer), [streamich/react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use) ([useTimeout](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useTimeout.md), [useSessionStorage](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useSessionStorage.md), [useLockBodyScroll](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useLockBodyScroll.md), [useLocalStorage](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useLocalStorage.md), [useToggle](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useToggle.md)) [bdbch/react-localstorage](https://github.com/bdbch/react-localstorage), [rehooks/local-storage](https://github.com/rehooks/local-storage), [react-rekindle/use-request](https://github.com/react-rekindle/use-request).\r\n\r\nHooks that use `[function, value]` pattern: none.\r\n\r\n## Is second value optional?\r\n\r\nOne could argue that, unlike with other examples, useTransition does not require the user to care about the `isPending` value. However, not using isPending creates a poor UX that the extisting React docs explicitly call out as a problem. We’re supposed to care about isPending. ([docs](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/blob/081bb31226919062938ef924472ba1b4170facfc/content/docs/concurrent-mode-patterns.md#adding-a-pending-indicator-adding-a-pending-indicator)).\r\n\r\nBesides, even with corrected value order, the user can still ignore isPending at a low cost of an explicit parameter skip (`const [, startTransition] = useTransition()`).\r\n\r\n## Can we return an object?\r\n\r\nuseState returns a list for convenient aliasing:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst [color, setColor] = useState();\r\nconst [position, setPosition] = useState();\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor hooks that a single component uses only once the benefit is significantly reduced and the community often chooses to return an object with named values instead. This removes the problem of getting positioned values incorrectly and is more inline with the broader JavaScript ecosystem.\r\n\r\nI am speculating here, but it seems like a component will often only have one transition, like [the Button example in the docs](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/blob/081bb31226919062938ef924472ba1b4170facfc/content/docs/concurrent-mode-patterns.md#baking-transitions-into-the-design-system-baking-transitions-into-the-design-system). In that case it seems beneficial to return named values and reserve the positioned return values for cases where it really matters.\r\n"

There's a state change resulting in the useEffect being called\r\n2. The useEffect callback starts a transition\r\n3. The transition callback sets state\r\n4. The set state results in a render which suspends\r\n\r\nIf these are all the case, then including the `startTransition` function in the dependency array will trigger an infinite loop. In the codesandbox I have a safety in place so your browser doesn't fall over.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe `startTransition` function should be consistent between renders.\r\n\r\nI've observed that if you do not inline the config to `useTransition` then this is not a problem. I know that the docs recommend keeping this config consistent, but if this is desirable behavior, then maybe a warning about this particular situation in the docs would be useful. I expect that inlining the config will be pretty natural for people.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n- react@0.0.0-experimental-f6b8d31a7\r\n- react-dom@0.0.0-experimental-f6b8d31a7"

      "body": "Wraps up #16980\r\n\r\nThis addresses some edge cases where React currently does a no-op render and an empty/unnecessary commit.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bailout without entering work loop for roots without work (see #16980).\r\n- [x] Fix failing refs-test by wrapping updates with `act()`.\r\n- [x] See if any other tests trigger this early bailout behavior to better understand the causes.\r\n\r\nThe tests listed below trigger this new early bailout code. Everyone is in `performSyncWorkOnRoot` (none trigger the new code in `performConcurrentWorkOnRoot`). I spot checked a couple of them to see why the new code is being hit, to see if it looked problematic. Below is my findings:\r\n\r\n* `ReactES6Class-test` \"_renders only once when setting state in componentWillMount_\"\r\nThis one calls `performSyncWorkOnRoot()` twice. The first time is the callback passed from `legacyRenderSubtreeIntoContainer` to `unbatchedUpdates`. The second one (the one that bails out) is when `unbatchedUpdates` calls `flushSyncCallbackQueue`. This flush can be bailed out on.\r\n\r\n* `RaectDOMInput-test` \"_should control a value in reentrant events_\"\r\nThis one hits the new codepath when it dispatch a discrete \"input\" event. It looks like when our test calls `node.dispatchEvent()` for the \"input\" event, something is actually dispatching a series of events (input, input, blur, focus) which causes more updates to be scheduled with React than necessary. Now we bail out after the first.\r\n\r\n* `ReactCompositeComponent` \"_should warn about `setState` in render_\"\r\nThis one calls `setState` in render. Without this call, the bailout codepath doesn't get hit. Looks like the `setState` call leaves two things in the queue, so when the subsequent call to `flushSyncCallbackQueue` flushes them both, the second one is a no-op. The first thing gets added to the queue when the `setState` call is made. The second one by `commitRootImpl()` when it calls `ensureRootIsScheduled()` because `getNextRootExpirationTimeToWorkOn` returns a value that indicates there's more work.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*

The issue was closed due to being caused by a browser plugin apparently. That's not the case here (will also make that closed case work).\r\n\r\nIn getVendorPrefixedEventName, the use case is to find the correct vendor prefixed event name. According to the MDN doc above these should not be available on a freshly created element with no style attribute set. Somehow it seems to work, except in my use case.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [getComputedStyle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle#Description) documentation, \"The element.style object should be used to set styles on that element, or inspect styles directly added to it from JavaScript manipulation or the global style attribute\"\r\n\r\nUsing getComputedStyle on the newly created element,  react-dom vendor prefixed event name sniffing runs, which makes sense given MDN docs as this is a readonly use case. After all react-dom is trying to go through all styles of the element, no just those set in it's style attribute.\r\n\r\n"

      "body": "This has already been discussed before (#14740), but there wasn't a reproducing example for this kind of issue and I think that my use case is also a bit different.\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nI believe this can be considered a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn order to reproduce this issue using Chrome, you will need to install the following Chrome extension called TransOver:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-11-03 at 22 51 33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10134421/68092541-86165d80-fe8c-11e9-9f39-e566f770fcb2.png)\r\n\r\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/transover/aggiiclaiamajehmlfpkjmlbadmkledi?hl=en\r\n\r\nI use it to translate text on hover.\r\nThe only thing that this extension does is appending a tooltip with the translated text to the `body` HTML element when you hover an element with text (it doesn't seem it appends stuff below the React's root `div` element).\r\n\r\nI have created two code sandboxes to show you better and explain the problem.\r\nIt is a minimal example of a movie app like the one Dan showed at JSConf 2018 in Iceland, though not as beautiful as his and without all that cool Suspense stuff, but at least it uses hooks :) .\r\n\r\n- https://codesandbox.io/s/heuristic-lake-exxvu\r\n\r\n- https://codesandbox.io/s/magical-grass-016kc\r\n\r\nThe two code sandboxes are essentially identical, the only difference is that the first one (`heuristic-lake-exxvu`) uses a `div` element for `MovieApp`, whereas the second (`magical-grass-016kc`) uses a `React.Fragment` (`<></>`) component:\r\n\r\n`heuristic-lake-exxvu`'s `MovieApp`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst MovieApp = () => {\r\n  const [currentMovie, setCurrentMovie] = useState(initialCurrentMovieState);\r\n  const { isLoading, id: currentMovieId, movieDetails } = currentMovie;\r\n  ...\r\n  return (\r\n    <div> // <======================= Uses a `div`\r\n      {isLoading ? (\r\n        \"Loading...\"\r\n      ) : (\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`magical-grass-016kc`'s `MovieApp`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst MovieApp = () => {\r\n  const [currentMovie, setCurrentMovie] = useState(initialCurrentMovieState);\r\n  const { isLoading, id: currentMovieId, movieDetails } = currentMovie;\r\n  ...\r\n  return (\r\n    <> // <======================= Uses a fragment\r\n      {isLoading ? (\r\n        \"Loading...\"\r\n      ) : (\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, if you open `heuristic-lake-exxvu` and click on the `Show movie info` button of any movie in the list, you will see the `Loading...` text before the promise with the data of the movie resolves, and the `Movie` component is rendered.\r\n\r\nBefore the promise resolves, try hovering on the `Loading...` text with the `TransOver` extension enabled, you should see:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-11-03 at 23 26 48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10134421/68093013-764d4800-fe91-11e9-8b64-2dbdade0a500.png)\r\n\r\nThe world makes sense here, no errors, no warnings, everything works.\r\n\r\nNow try to do the same thing on `magical-grass-016kc`, as soon as you hover `Loading...`, you will see the `NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node'` error logged in the browser's console:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-11-03 at 23 40 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10134421/68093177-49019980-fe93-11e9-9f9b-13f91a12e996.png)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-11-03 at 23 40 52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10134421/68093194-6df60c80-fe93-11e9-910f-ae748bc9fb91.png)\r\n\r\nHere is a streamable video showing this same error:\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/4gxua\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIn `heuristic-lake-exxvu` (uses a `div` instead of React fragment), everything worked.\r\nThe TransOver extension appends to `body` and does not modify the React's root `div` neither does it append stuff below it, so I would expect the code in the React fragment example (`magical-grass-016kc`) to behave the same and work as in `heuristic-lake-exxvu`.\r\n\r\nChrome is plenty of useful extensions like this one and they should not really interfere with React, I think that users using React applications may also install other extensions which modify the DOM which they find useful.\r\nIf an extension appends to body like TransOver does, I wouldn't expect React to have problems with it and cause undesirable effects and application errors like this one.\r\n\r\nThis is my opinion, I would be very glad to hear what you think about it, and if you think I have spotted a bug of React fragments (I think it's a bug because, again, it works when using a `div` in `heuristic-lake-exxvu`).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nBrowser: Chrome\r\nReact v16.11.0\r\nReact DOM v16.11.0\r\n\r\n\r\n"

If you setState or something in those events, they should probably behave as if you're already on the new tree.\r\n\r\nSimilarly if we do end up triggering blur/focus events simulated, then those should see the updated tree.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this would fire before life-cycles which is confusing. Although that also happens if you set focus manually on the DOM in a life-cycle too. Triggering a blur after life-cycles could work but needs to take into account that focus can change possibly several times in the life-cycles too.\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17214"

I considered using a `typeof` check, but I'm not sure if adding the extra branches is useful. The branch could potentially avoid creating a closure on the common case, though.

This check is very, very important, as it's incredibly easy to forget about just once place where potential user data is passed onto DOM way. And of course, allowing a javascript: URL to be injected into DOM is a very serious XSS issue.\r\n\r\nI griped before that this is too important to be just a warning, and suggested that a semver-compatible solution is to provide an exported function that allows a runtime opt-in to the new safe behavior. This suggestion was dismissed, since if I want this, I can just make my own build of react with the flag enabled. (Of course, almost no one will do this, because it's just too much of a pain to make your own dependency builds with every release)\r\n\r\nI'd like to make a similar suggestion again. Since Concurrent and Blocking modes are coming soon(ish), and make many breaking changes anyway, why not take this opportunity to also block unsafe javascript: URLs when the mode is enabled? I know that URLs have nothing to do with concurrent mode (unlike unsafe lifecycle methods, etc.), but since many people will want to jump onto this new feature anyway and are willing to deal with some migration required anyway, why not add this vital security precaution as well?\r\n\r\nWaiting until React 17 to protect… well, probably countless React apps that don't properly sanitize URLs, just doesn't seem reasonable, when the feature is already implemented, only disabled under a feature flag.\r\n\r\ncc @gaearon @sebmarkbage "

This is not a problem in se because of the idempotent nature of `render()` (which has to be pure), but makes me think that this is an unneeded call because if an error has been thrown in `render()`, re-executing it right away would still lead to the same exception being thrown.\r\n\r\nOr, is there something I am missing? Maybe related to how React works internally and because of that it needs to recall `render()` as soon as that same `render()` has thrown...\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

The following image is probably a good overview:\r\n\r\n![reconciler](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2223602/67144414-59502c80-f276-11e9-89d1-97496ee10b8c.jpg)\r\n\r\nBasically i have a reconciler, it has a root instance, a scene in my case into which everything's rendered. I keep special information in that scene, which i need when constructing new objects.\r\n\r\nNow, when i use createPortal, like so:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction A() {\r\n  // Create virtual scene\r\n  const virtualScene = useMemo(() => new THREE.Scene(), [])\r\n\r\n  // Render elements into the virtual scene via createPortal\r\n  return createPortal(\r\n    <mesh onClick={() => console.log(\"clicked\")}>\r\n      <meshNormalMaterial attach=\"material\" />\r\n      <boxBufferGeometry attach=\"geometry\" args={[10, 10, 10]} />\r\n    </mesh>\r\n    virtualScene,\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the createInstance inside the reconciler will receive the following:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\ncreateInstance(\r\n  type = \"meshNormalMaterial\",\r\n  props = { attach: \"material\" },\r\n  container = virtualScene,\r\n  hostContext = {},\r\n  internalInstanceHandle = { ... }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem that i face is that i also need to know the root instance into which the portal is rendered, but there seem to be no obvious means to get it. Digging around i noticed that the  internalInstanceHandle fibernode contains it when i traverse it:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst fn = (node: Reconciler.Fiber): THREE.Object3D => {\r\n  if (!node.return) return node.stateNode.containerInfo\r\n  else return fn(node.return)\r\n}\r\nlet scene = fn(internalInstanceHandle) // ---> the root scene\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that seems pretty sketchy.

      "body": "**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'm trying to write a small `Title` component to render nested document titles. However the kinda unexpected order in which effect clean-up functions are called makes it impossible to do this : \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { Children, useEffect } from 'react'\r\n\r\nexport default ({ children }) => {\r\n  const subtitle = Children.toArray(children).join('')\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const root = document.title\r\n    document.title = `${subtitle} - ${root}`\r\n    console.log('Wrote', document.title)\r\n    return () => {\r\n      document.title = root\r\n      console.log('Restored', document.title)\r\n    }\r\n  }, [subtitle])\r\n  return null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a loosy sketch of my component structure (handled with `@reach/router`) : \r\n\r\n```\r\nApp                     // contains <Title>App</Title>\r\n> Dashboard             // contains <Title>Dashboard</Title>\r\n> Profile               // contains <Title>Profile</Title>\r\n> Project               // contains <Title>Project</Title>\r\n  > Calendar            // contains <Title>Calendar</Title>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach one of these components calls my `Title` component. Everything works fine when going from profile to dashboard or from dashboard to project. But when I jump from calendar to dashboard, the document title gets messed up because the clean-up in Project is called **before** the clean-up in Calendar even though Calendar is a child of Project, which is kinda unexpected and makes tree side-effect logic using (just) `useEffect` simply impossible.\r\n\r\nThe order in which the effect functions are called is a direct reflection of the order in which the components are nested. Shouldn't the clean-up functions be called following the exact reverse order ? Isn't that one of the goals of a clean-up ?\r\n\r\nWhen I navigate to the calendar and then back to the dashboard, I get the following logs : \r\n\r\n```\r\nWrote App\r\nWrote Project - App\r\nWrote Calendar - Project - App\r\nRestored App                          // This should happen after...\r\nRestored Project - App                // ...this.\r\nWrote Dashboard - Project - App       // This is messed up.\r\n```\r\n\r\n[codesandbox here](https://codesandbox.io/s/vigilant-feynman-0jxwb?fontsize=14)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nHere is what I expected and what I would get if clean-ups in children were to be called before clean-ups in parents : \r\n\r\n```\r\nWrote App\r\nWrote Project - App\r\nWrote Calendar - Project - App\r\nRestored Project - App\r\nRestored App\r\nWrote Dashboard - App\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm using React 16.10.2.\r\n\r\nThis ugly workaround works by \"forcing\" the order of what the clean-ups do (by keeping manually track of the effect functions' order and then just going the other way) : \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst stack = []\r\n\r\nexport default ({ children }) => {\r\n  const subtitle = Children.toArray(children).join('')\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    stack.push(document.title)\r\n    document.title = `${subtitle} - ${last(stack)}`\r\n    return () => {\r\n      document.title = stack.pop()\r\n    }\r\n  }, [subtitle])\r\n  return null\r\n}\r\n```"

See:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-concurrent-state-bug-sp6zq\r\n\r\nNot an expert on concurrent mode here, was just playing around with it. Noticed that when some interactions happen the work (probably moved to the other tree) gets lost if the parent re-renders.

      "body": "It's about the dreaded \"zombie-child\" problem, which is a known problem, but i would still like to open this issue in order to track it. It currently throws a major wrench into our projects at work (which all use mixed reconcilers).\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nI consider it a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe long explanation is here: https://kaihao.dev/posts/Stale-props-and-zombie-children-in-Redux\r\n\r\nIn short, when any dispatch, for instance via useState/useReducer.set(...), can cause an _immediate_ render pass, it allows leaf-components to render before their parents. Components that shouldn't even be rendering, because their parents would exclude them, now do render and access data which doesn't exist in the state model any longer. Rendering isn't deterministic and hierarchical any longer.\r\n\r\nDan Abramov acknowledges this behaviour here: https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/959507572951797761\r\n\r\nThe current solution that Sebastian Markbåge suggested is to wrap dispatches into batchedUpdates.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't work in mixed-mode React, where multiple reconcilers are active. So the same component will work in one reconciler, but crash in another, unless the dispatch is wrapped into each batchedUpdates from each reconciler - which puts the burden onto the consumer of the component and makes the component platform dependent.\r\n\r\nThis problem affects all flex based state managers. Redux for instance. Some fail outright, some do implement batchedUpdates (like Redux), but they will all fail in mixed-mode.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/react-spring/zustand/issues/64\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAs Dan Abramov himself said on Twitter, any dispatch should be async. But this was in feb 2018. Is there any news regarding this behaviour?\r\n\r\nThe churn outlined in the kaihao.dev article above, just to get simple state management, is almost overwhelming. Its conclusion is \"Our hands are tied, there's no solution yet to be known.\" I know this probably isn't a pressing issue, but i hope it can be prioritized."

      "body": "This feature relates to several new React APIs: concurrent mode, suspense, and server rendering / hydration\r\n\r\n# Background info\r\nWhen hydrating server-rendered content, React starts working on the outermost Suspense boundary and works its way in. During hydration, the server rendered HTML isn't interactive. React records events to replay them once content becomes interactive- (but that doesn't actually happen until React finishes work on the nearest boundary and commits it). React may also reprioritize the order in which boundaries are processed (so that boundaries with pending events get processed sooner).\r\n\r\nThis general process can be hard to reason about and debug, because much of it is not observable visually (beyond some interactions potentially feeling more laggy than expected).\r\n\r\nDevTools already provides some visual overlays (e.g. which elements were rendered by the currently selected Component, [\"highlight updates\"](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16989)). Perhaps DevTools could help here too by visualizing which boundaries in the tree have been hydrated.\r\n\r\n# Visualizing hydration progress\r\n1. When React begins hydrating a new root<sup>1</sup> DevTools will show a visual overlay<sup>2</sup> that covers the entire DOM element container.\r\n1. As React hydrates and commits each new level of Suspense boundaries, DevTools will draw the overlay to only cover the not-yet-hydrated boundaries.\r\n1. Once hydration is completed, all overlays will be cleared<sup>3</sup>.\r\n\r\nThis feature would be opt-in via a new DevTools setting.\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> This suggests a new React-to-DevTools hook to inform DevTools when hydration starts.\r\n\r\n<sup>2</sup> This overlay would nee to be designed. Perhaps some combination of semi-transparent with stripes or bars so that it is high contrast enough to be seen.\r\n\r\n<sup>3</sup> Because the data required to draw these overlays is essentially just a timestamp and a set of rects, some form of replay might be a nice addition.\r\n\r\n# Special cases\r\nIt could be helpful to highlight a couple of special cases by temporarily showing a different style overlay:\r\n\r\n* **Client rendered content inside of a server rendered fallback.** ([This case.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/bb680a09052b5af6543daf28bfcc3283bbc35cf9/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L2030-L2039)) In some cases, the server rendered content may be a forced fallback that gets filled in with client rendered content.\r\n* **React can't complete hydration fast enough to process a client-side update.** ([This case.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/bb680a09052b5af6543daf28bfcc3283bbc35cf9/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L2064-L2074)) In this case, React ends up deleting the server-rendered content and replacing it with client rendered content. For example, a layout effect may set state on an ancestor that updates context. This update is synchronous (because it comes from within a layout effect) so it immediately expires.\r\n\r\nI don't know if the above cases can be reliably detected by DevTools at present. They may require additional information (or an additional React-to-DevTools hook).\r\n\r\nThe following case does **not** need to be highlighted because it is not a deopt:\r\n* **Server rendered content removed before hydration.** In some cases, server rendered content is thrown away before hydration completes because of a user interaction. For example, if the user navigates to a new page before the initial page has finished hydrating."

      "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI initially asked this on Twitter and @gaearon suggested me to open an issue instead.\r\nThe original thread is here: https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1178328607376232449?s=19\r\nMore easy to read here: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1178328607376232449.html\r\nBut will try to make this issue more clear and structured about my args and questions.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I really like hooks, but wonder if we can't have smarter abstractions and official patterns that make dealing with them more easy for authors and consumers.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n## Workaround for the stale closure\r\n\r\nAfter using hooks for a while, and being familiar with the stale closure problem, I don't really understand why we need to handle closure dependencies, instead of just doing something like the following code, which always executes latest provided closure (capturing fresh variables)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65869094-f7d52600-e379-11e9-9634-1ab06b41e3ca.png)\r\n\r\nCoupling the dependencies of the closure and the conditions to trigger effect re-execution does not make much sense to me. For me it's perfectly valid to want to capture some variables in the closure, yet when those variables change we don't necessarily want to re-execute.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases where people are using refs to \"stabilize\" some value that should not trigger re-execution, or to access fresh values in closures.\r\n\r\nExamples in major libs includes:\r\n- Formik (code is pretty similar to my \"useSafeEffect\" above): https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/blob/master/src/Formik.tsx#L975\r\n- React-redux, which uses refs to access fresh props: https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/b6b47995acfb8c1ff5d04a31c14aa75f112a47ab/src/components/connectAdvanced.js#L286\r\n\r\nAlso @Andarist (who maintains a few important React libs for a while): \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65872332-9d8b9380-e380-11e9-90b3-bf294991bb82.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe often find in such codebase the \"useIsomorphicLayoutEffect\" hook which permits to ensure that the ref is set the earliest, and try to avoid the useLayoutEffect warning (see https://gist.github.com/gaearon/e7d97cdf38a2907924ea12e4ebdf3c85). What we are doing here seems unrelated to layout and makes me a bit uncomfortable btw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Do we need an ESLint rule?\r\n\r\nThe ESLint rule looks to me only useful to avoid the stale closure problem. Without the stale closure problem (which the trick above solves), you can just focus on crafting the array/conditions for effect re-execution and don't need ESLint for that.\r\n\r\nAlso this would make it easier to wrap useEffect in userland without the fear to exposing users to stale closure problem, because eslint plugin won't notice missing dependencies for custom hooks.\r\n\r\nHere's some code for react-navigation (alpha/v5). To me this is weird to have to ask the user to \"useCallback\" just to stabilize the closure of useFocusEffect, just to ensure the effect only runs on messageId change.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65869719-3d462300-e37b-11e9-94d2-5200481588bc.png)\r\n\r\nNot sure to understand why we can't simply use the following instead. For which I don't see the point of using any ESLint rule. I just want the effect to run on messageId change, this is explicit enough for me and there's no \"trap\"\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65869777-564ed400-e37b-11e9-8570-12534e5f2a53.png)\r\n\r\nI've heard that the [React team recommends rather the later](https://twitter.com/satya164/status/1178571088172896256), asking the user to useCallback, instead of building custom hooks taking a dependency array, why exactly? Also heard that the ESLint plugin now was able to detect missing deps in a custom hook, if you add the [hook name to ESLint conf](https://twitter.com/n1rual/status/1178568248062877701). Not, sure what to think we are supposed to do in the end.\r\n\r\n## Are we safe using workarounds?\r\n\r\nIt's still a bit hard for me to be sure which kind of code is \"safe\" regarding React's upcoming features, particularly Concurrent Mode. \r\n\r\nIf I use the `useEffectSafe` above or something equivalent relying on refs, I am safe and future proof?\r\n\r\nIf this is safe, and makes my life easier, why do I have to build this abstraction myself? \r\n\r\nWouldn't it make sense to make this kind of pattern more \"official\" / documented?\r\n\r\nI keep adding this kind of code to every project I work with:\r\n\r\n```tsx \r\nconst useGetter = <S>(value: S): (() => S) => {\r\n  const ref = useRef(value);\r\n  useIsomorphicLayoutEffect(() => {\r\n    ref.current = value;\r\n  });\r\n  return useCallback(() => ref.current, [ref]);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n(including important community projects like [react-navigation-hooks](https://github.com/react-navigation/hooks/blob/master/src/Hooks.ts#L46))\r\n\r\n## Is it a strategy to teach users?\r\n\r\nIs it a choice of the React team to not ship safer abstractions officially and make sure the users hit the closure problem early and get familiar with it? \r\n\r\nBecause anyway, even when using getters, we still can't prevent the user to capture some value. This has been documented by @sebmarkbage [here](https://gist.github.com/sebmarkbage/a5ef436427437a98408672108df01919) with async code, even with a getter, we can't prevent the user to do things like:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nonMount(async () => {\r\n  let isEligible = getIsEligible();\r\n  let data = await fetch(...);\r\n  // at this point, isEligible might has changed: we should rather use `getIsEligible()` again instead of storing a boolean in the closure (might depend on the usecase though, but maybe we can imagine isEligible => isMounted)\r\n  if (isEligible) {\r\n    doStuff(data);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```  \r\nAs far as I understand, this might be the case:\r\n\r\n> So you can easily get into the same situation even with a mutable source value. React just makes you always deal with it so that you don't get too far down the road before you have to refactor you code to deal with these cases anyway. I'm really glad how well the React community has dealt with this since the release of hooks because it really sets us up to predictably deal with more complex scenario and for doing more things in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n## A concrete problem\r\n\r\nA react-navigation-hooks user reported that his effect run too much, using the following code:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65870979-bf374b80-e37d-11e9-8a6c-1f7df8503c18.png)\r\n\r\nIn practice, this is because react-navigation core does not provide stable `navigate` function, and thus the hooks too. The core does not necessarily want to \"stabilize\" the navigate function and guarantee that contract in its API.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me what should I do, between officially stabilizing the `navigate` function in the hooks project (relying on core, so core can still return distinct navigate functions), or if I should ask the user to stabilize the function himself in userland, leading to pain and boilerplate for many users trying to use the API.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why you can't simply dissociate the closure dependencies to the effect's triggering, and simply omitting the `navigate` function here:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65871264-51d7ea80-e37e-11e9-837d-291775853b2e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat bothers me is that somehow as hooks lib authors we now have to think about whether what we return to the user is stable or not, ie safe to use in an effect dependency array without unwanted effect re-executions.\r\n\r\nReturning a stable value in v1 and unstable in v2 is a breaking change that might break users apps in nasty ways, and we have to document this too in our api doc, or ask the user to not trust us, and do the memoization work themselves, which is quite error prone and verbose. Now as lib authors we have to think not only about the inputs/outputs, but also about preserving identities or not (it's probably not a new problem, because we already need to in userland for optimisations anyway).\r\n\r\nAsking users to do this memoization themselves is error prone and verbose. And intuitively some people will maybe want to `useMemo` (just because of the naming) which actually can tricks them by not offering the same guarantees than `useCallback`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## A tradeoff between different usecases in the name of a consistent API?\r\n\r\n@satya164 also mentionned that there are also usecases where the [ESLint plugin saved him](https://twitter.com/satya164/status/1178395620236759043) more than once because he forgot some dependency, and for him, it's more easy to fix an effect re-executing too much than to find out about some cached value not updating. \r\n\r\nI see how the ESLint plugin is really handy for usecases such as building a stable object to optimize renders or provide a stable context value. \r\n\r\nBut for useEffect, when capturing functions, sometimes executing 2 functions with distinct identities actually lead to the same result. Having to add those functions to dependencies is quite annoying in such case. \r\n\r\nBut I totally understand we want to guarantee some kind of consistency across all hooks API.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nI try to understand some of the tradeoffs being made in the API. Not sure to understand yet the whole picture, and I'm probably not alone. \r\n\r\n@gaearon said to open an issue with a comment: `It's more nuanced`. I'm here to discuss all the nuances if possible :)\r\n\r\nWhat particularly bothers me currently is not necessarily the existing API. It's rather:\r\n- the dogmatism of absolutely wanting to conform the ESLint rules (for which I don't agree with for all usecases). Currently I think users are really afraid to not follow the rules.\r\n- the lack of official patterns on how we are supposed to handle some specific hooks cases. And I think the \"getter\" pattern should be a thing that every hooks users know about and learn very early. Eventually adding such pattern in core would make it even more visible. Currently it's more lib authors and tech leads that all find out about this pattern in userland with small implementation variations.\r\n\r\nThose are the solutions that I think of. As I said I may miss something important and may change my opinions according to the answers.\r\n\r\nAs an author of a few React libs, I feel a bit frustrated to not be 100% sure what kind of API contract I should offer to my lib's users. I'm also not sure about the hooks patterns I can recommend or not. I plan to open-source something soon but don't even know if that's a good idea, and if it goes in the direction the React team want to go with hooks.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This works well on smaller sites, or in a situation where your company may have a monorepo and can enforce and track these warnings.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIn addition to this behavior, it would be beneficial to React developers if they could have ESLint plugins that had rules for these warnings. Ideally, the ESLint plugin could fix simple cases (methods being renamed) and in more complex cases recommend a codemod.\r\n\r\n——-\r\n\r\nI’m posting this here as per discussion with @acdlite on twitter. See this thread: https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1178018850937290753?s=21\r\n\r\nUltimately, it is harder for shops that do micro frontends to ensure everyone is compliant with new React versions. It is also easier to catch things early at build time then to dig around in the browser runtime when there may be other compounding issues.\r\n\r\nThe other benefit of this would be that it would enable third party libraries to potentially have “day 1 support” for new major React versions because they could follow the rule set and ensure that they are forwards compatible without being caught trying to do it all at once.\r\n\r\nLastly, I’m happy to help drive/contribute to any rule set to make sure it works in our use case.\r\n"

      "body": "As a library author, I test against both the `@next` and `@latest` versions of `react` and `react-dom` (as well as 16.3, the oldest version we support). The rationale for that is to know up front if the upcoming version of React is going to break our library. I think this is good practice for everyone involved.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when 16.9 was released, there was only 1 week between promoting the RC to `@next`, and promoting that to `@latest`. Because the last RC broke the way `act` works, I had only 1 week to fix our unit test suite, which was all the sudden mostly failing. In fact we had to wait for `react-testing-library` to be updated to deal with this change.\r\n\r\nLuckily I was able to scramble and find time to fix this before the final release, but this won't always be the case. I imagine other library authors may struggle with this too. As such I would like to see at least a 2 week window between `next` and `latest`. I hope that's feasible.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if there's a better way to test for future compatibility."

For the full example, see my codesandbox below.\r\n\r\nIn the codesandbox, if you change the value of the input, the new value is provided to the context which causes the hook used in `MemoizedChild` (`useValue`) to throw a promise. This flips `Suspense` to the fallback state and when the promise resolves `MemoizedChild`'s state is not updated with the proper context value because (I'm assuming) the memoized value of `MemoizedChild` is the one that contained the previous context value and technically no props have changed, so that makes sense why it wouldn't have updated. However, this seems like it would be unexpected behavior.\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-suspense-maybe-bug-sznbk\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI would expect that `MemoizedChild` would be re-rendered with the new provided value.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

        "body": "**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nFeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nI have played a bit with Concurrent Mode and the Suspense API.\r\nReally exiting features and I look forward to use them in a stable release. Thank you for everything you are doing!\r\n\r\nRegarding the `Suspense` component, could it be nice to have a property (both in Concurrent Mode and in \"normal/synchronous\" mode) which would allow us to set the minimum duration of the `Suspense` fallback UI in case the fallback UI ever gets rendered?\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nLet me do an example. Try clicking on the `Next` button in this codesandbox: \r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/cold-monad-ifr29.\r\n\r\nYou will see that the `Suspense` fallback UI is rendered and stays in the tree just for a little moment (`~200ms`) because both promises resolve in `1200ms`, while `useTransition` has a `timeoutMs` of 1 second.\r\nIn my opinion, this is a bit unpleasant to the eye.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be nicer if we could tell the `Suspense` component something like \"If you ever render the fallback, show it for at least N millisec.\"? E.g.:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n...\r\nfunction ProfilePage({ resource }) {\r\n  return (\r\n    <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading profile...</h1>}\r\n      // If the fallback ever gets rendered,\r\n      // it will be shown for at least 1500 millisec.,\r\n      // even if the promise resolves right after rendering the fallback.\r\n      fallbackMinDurationMs={1500}>\r\n      <ProfileDetails resource={resource} />\r\n      <Suspense fallback={<h1>Loading posts...</h1>}>\r\n        <ProfileTimeline resource={resource} />\r\n      </Suspense>\r\n    </Suspense>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nConsider an animated spinner used as a fallback of `Suspense`, if it happens that the promise resolves just a few milliseconds after rendering the fallback like above, the spinner will be rendered and suddenly disappear, without completing its animation cycle and showing an incomplete animation.\r\n\r\nWhereas, if we could keep the spinner in the tree for at least `fallbackMinDurationMs` millisec. once rendered, we could improve its appearance in such cases.\r\n\r\nThe `Suspense` component responsible for rendering the fallback would have to wrap the caught Promise in a promise which would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction maxDelayFallbackPromise({\r\n  promise,\r\n  timeoutMs, // ---> This would be the value of `useTransition`'s `timeoutMs`\r\n  onFallback = () => {}, // ---> This code would run in case `timeoutMs` exceeds (i.e. when `Suspense`'s fallback UI is rendered)\r\n  fallbackMinDurationMs\r\n} = {}) {\r\n  // Generate a unique identifier, like a string, a number, in order to identify which promise resolves first...\r\n  const uniqueIdentifier = `promise_value_${Math.random()}`\r\n  return Promise.race([\r\n    promise,\r\n    timeout(timeoutMs).then(() => uniqueIdentifier)\r\n  ]).then(value => {\r\n    if (value === uniqueIdentifier) {\r\n      onFallback()\r\n      return minDelayPromise(promise, fallbackMinDurationMs)\r\n    }\r\n    else {\r\n      return value\r\n    }\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `timeout` and `minDelayPromise` are:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction timeout(delayMs) {\r\n  return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delayMs))\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction minDelayPromise(promise, minDelay) {\r\n  return Promise.all([\r\n    promise,\r\n    timeout(minDelay)\r\n  ]).then(([value]) => {\r\n    return value\r\n  })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could also apply to the `isPending` flag of `useTransition`...\r\n\r\nDo you think such a feature could improve the UX in such cases?\r\n"

Explicit fallback views are most likely impossible (that's why we need layout in the first place) or the component itself is a sufficient fallback (e.g. the overall markup is renderable on the server but we need to adjust some minor visuals).\r\n\r\nSince components using `useLayoutEffect` will always have an inconsistent UI before hydration we can potentially downgrade these effects to passive effects i.e. it's already inconsistent so we might as well make it inconsistent a little bit longer to make room for higher priority work.\r\n\r\n## Behavior\r\n\r\n- like useEffect when ssr\r\n- like useEffect when hydrating\r\n- like useLayoutEffect when rendering on the client\r\n- like useLayoutEffect on updates\r\n\r\n"

So we aren't going to be very good stewards of its API going forward.\r\n\r\nMy proposal was for Enzyme or folks interested in it to copy the code into another repo, and continue maintaining it there under a difference package name. It would make sense to Enzyme to start depending on that fork.

By that I mean that I could type in for example \"Editor\" in the search box, and only components with `Editor` in their name (eg. `<Editor />`, `<MyEditor />`, etc.) would show up.\r\n\r\nIt would show the matching components, and have the option to expand them (or be pre-expanded), so it shows the components and their children.\r\n\r\nFor example, right now when loading the page, I see this:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/311752/68510359-54611600-0241-11ea-978e-59d5959031d2.png)\r\n\r\nWhich is a lot of extra stuff in the components tree that I don't care about.

This is done outside of the React event handler (ie: via `window.addEventLIstener` and so the updates are not batched together. The update to render the numbers is artificially slowed down. \r\n\r\nIf you click the \"Increment Remote Count\" button multiple times, the update works as expected. \r\n\r\nIf you interrupt the update, via clicking the \"increment local count\", only the last number will update. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the Steps to reproduce look like: \r\n1. Click the \"Increment Remote Count\" button once\r\n2. Before the update is committed to the DOM, click the \"Increment Local Count\" update. \r\n3. The first update is \"lost\" ie; the output looks like: \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/787007/68468141-27255f80-0263-11ea-9afb-07964e21d9d9.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nhttps://jwenc.csb.app/ \\ https://codesandbox.io/s/usesubscriptionconcurrentlosingupdates-jwenc \r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'd expect there to be a commit as the above screenshot, but I'd then expect there to be a follow-up commit that restores the consistency. In other words, I'd expect in the above picture for everything to be `1` \r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n`0.0.0-experimental-f6b8d31a7`\r\n\r\n\r\nI'd be willing to try to take a stab at writing a React test for this, if needed? \r\n\r\n"

If we could somehow have the fallback component receive some kind of state from Suspense on when it is mounting and unmounting the fallback component, that would be great.\r\n"

This prevents it from invalidating downstream memoizations, like `useCallback`.\r\n\r\nWe do use `useCallback` internally so that a new `startTransition` is only created when the config object changes. However, if you pass an object, this does nothing because the object different every time.\r\n\r\nPotential fixes:\r\n\r\n- Instead of detecting changes in the config object, compare the fields (`timeoutMs` et al) directly. This fixes the worst case (inline config object) but still means we'll occasionally re-create `startTransition` functions.\r\n- Track the current config object on an internal mutable field using an effect and read from that instead of binding a new method each time. This requires extra work in the commit phase, but combined with the previous option (comparing the fields instead of the entire config object) that should be rare.\r\n- Instead of passing the config object to the `useTransition` hook, pass it to the `startTransition` function. This avoids needing to bind the config object to the method. Slightly less ergonomic, however, we're planning to change the default config object so that it's not needed in most cases. So it's only in special cases that you'd actually use one. **This is the most likely option**."

For example, a utility function that concatenates a string:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nexport greet(name) {\r\n  return `Hello, ${name}!`;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanging the returned string to `Yo, ${name}!` would trigger this module to reload in the browser, but because components which depended on it don't reload, the old greeting will persist \r\nuntil the next render of each dependent component.\r\n\r\n(BTW in actuality, some tooling will reload immediate dependents of modules that are reloaded in order to get around similar problems. You can extend the dependency chain from two to three modules, where `a.js` depends on `b.js` depends on `c.js`, and you will get the same result when editing `c.js`)\r\n\r\nWhat this forces tooling to do is apply a heuristic to try and guess whether a given module should be refreshed, vs. completely restart the app in order to cause all components to re-mount and pick up any changes that wouldn't be picked up by react-refresh.\r\n\r\nThe problems with the heuristic approach is:\r\n- each dev tool needs to implement this logic, leading to more potential for bugs\r\n- it leads to a degradation of hot reloading capabilities based on what your module exports. not obvious at all on it's face and will lead people to twisting their code base to route around this\r\n- It's very unfriendly to compile-to-JS languages like ReasonML, ClojureScript, etc. which might have different default semantics for what is public / private, different conventions for naming components, etc. which make it difficult to detect whether a module is \"safe\" to refresh\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThat components depended on newly loaded code will pick up those changes correctly, without losing state.\r\n\r\nA potential (maybe naive?) solution to this in react-refresh is, instead of only re-rendering the components marked as dirty (due to a different `type` being registered), to _re-render from the root_ while maintaining hooks state. If components' signatures have changed, then re-mount.\r\n\r\nI've read through and kind of grok most of the code in react-refresh, but I'm not sure how this would impact the way that the reconciler currently handles the HMR stuff. This is as much of a question, as it is a request: could this be a viable solution?\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time and energy in reading through this. I'm very excited about having first-class support for hot reloading in React, as it's been something that I've loved ever since seeing the first demo of it. I hope that this issue can help create a way to provide a consistently excellent dev experience across tools/platforms/languages!\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.11"

Hooks that use `[value, function]` pattern:\r\n\r\n[useImmer](https://github.com/immerjs/use-immer#useimmer), [streamich/react-use](https://github.com/streamich/react-use) ([useTimeout](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useTimeout.md), [useSessionStorage](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useSessionStorage.md), [useLockBodyScroll](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useLockBodyScroll.md), [useLocalStorage](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useLocalStorage.md), [useToggle](https://github.com/streamich/react-use/blob/master/docs/useToggle.md)) [bdbch/react-localstorage](https://github.com/bdbch/react-localstorage), [rehooks/local-storage](https://github.com/rehooks/local-storage), [react-rekindle/use-request](https://github.com/react-rekindle/use-request).\r\n\r\nHooks that use `[function, value]` pattern: none.\r\n\r\n## Is second value optional?\r\n\r\nOne could argue that, unlike with other examples, useTransition does not require the user to care about the `isPending` value. However, not using isPending creates a poor UX that the extisting React docs explicitly call out as a problem. We’re supposed to care about isPending. ([docs](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/blob/081bb31226919062938ef924472ba1b4170facfc/content/docs/concurrent-mode-patterns.md#adding-a-pending-indicator-adding-a-pending-indicator)).\r\n\r\nBesides, even with corrected value order, the user can still ignore isPending at a low cost of an explicit parameter skip (`const [, startTransition] = useTransition()`).\r\n\r\n## Can we return an object?\r\n\r\nuseState returns a list for convenient aliasing:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst [color, setColor] = useState();\r\nconst [position, setPosition] = useState();\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor hooks that a single component uses only once the benefit is significantly reduced and the community often chooses to return an object with named values instead. This removes the problem of getting positioned values incorrectly and is more inline with the broader JavaScript ecosystem.\r\n\r\nI am speculating here, but it seems like a component will often only have one transition, like [the Button example in the docs](https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/blob/081bb31226919062938ef924472ba1b4170facfc/content/docs/concurrent-mode-patterns.md#baking-transitions-into-the-design-system-baking-transitions-into-the-design-system). In that case it seems beneficial to return named values and reserve the positioned return values for cases where it really matters.\r\n"

        "body": "Wraps up #16980\r\n\r\nThis addresses some edge cases where React currently does a no-op render and an empty/unnecessary commit.\r\n\r\n- [x] Bailout without entering work loop for roots without work (see #16980).\r\n- [x] Fix failing refs-test by wrapping updates with `act()`.\r\n- [x] See if any other tests trigger this early bailout behavior to better understand the causes.\r\n\r\nThe tests listed below trigger this new early bailout code. Everyone is in `performSyncWorkOnRoot` (none trigger the new code in `performConcurrentWorkOnRoot`). I spot checked a couple of them to see why the new code is being hit, to see if it looked problematic. Below is my findings:\r\n\r\n* `ReactES6Class-test` \"_renders only once when setting state in componentWillMount_\"\r\nThis one calls `performSyncWorkOnRoot()` twice. The first time is the callback passed from `legacyRenderSubtreeIntoContainer` to `unbatchedUpdates`. The second one (the one that bails out) is when `unbatchedUpdates` calls `flushSyncCallbackQueue`. This flush can be bailed out on.\r\n\r\n* `RaectDOMInput-test` \"_should control a value in reentrant events_\"\r\nThis one hits the new codepath when it dispatch a discrete \"input\" event. It looks like when our test calls `node.dispatchEvent()` for the \"input\" event, something is actually dispatching a series of events (input, input, blur, focus) which causes more updates to be scheduled with React than necessary. Now we bail out after the first.\r\n\r\n* `ReactCompositeComponent` \"_should warn about `setState` in render_\"\r\nThis one calls `setState` in render. Without this call, the bailout codepath doesn't get hit. Looks like the `setState` call leaves two things in the queue, so when the subsequent call to `flushSyncCallbackQueue` flushes them both, the second one is a no-op. The first thing gets added to the queue when the `setState` call is made. The second one by `commitRootImpl()` when it calls `ensureRootIsScheduled()` because `getNextRootExpirationTimeToWorkOn` returns a value that indicates there's more work.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n*

The issue was closed due to being caused by a browser plugin apparently. That's not the case here (will also make that closed case work).\r\n\r\nIn getVendorPrefixedEventName, the use case is to find the correct vendor prefixed event name. According to the MDN doc above these should not be available on a freshly created element with no style attribute set. Somehow it seems to work, except in my use case.\r\n\r\nAccording to the [getComputedStyle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/getComputedStyle#Description) documentation, \"The element.style object should be used to set styles on that element, or inspect styles directly added to it from JavaScript manipulation or the global style attribute\"\r\n\r\nUsing getComputedStyle on the newly created element,  react-dom vendor prefixed event name sniffing runs, which makes sense given MDN docs as this is a readonly use case. After all react-dom is trying to go through all styles of the element, no just those set in it's style attribute.\r\n\r\n"

        "body": "This has already been discussed before (#14740), but there wasn't a reproducing example for this kind of issue and I think that my use case is also a bit different.\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nI believe this can be considered a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nIn order to reproduce this issue using Chrome, you will need to install the following Chrome extension called TransOver:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-11-03 at 22 51 33](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10134421/68092541-86165d80-fe8c-11e9-9f39-e566f770fcb2.png)\r\n\r\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/transover/aggiiclaiamajehmlfpkjmlbadmkledi?hl=en\r\n\r\nI use it to translate text on hover.\r\nThe only thing that this extension does is appending a tooltip with the translated text to the `body` HTML element when you hover an element with text (it doesn't seem it appends stuff below the React's root `div` element).\r\n\r\nI have created two code sandboxes to show you better and explain the problem.\r\nIt is a minimal example of a movie app like the one Dan showed at JSConf 2018 in Iceland, though not as beautiful as his and without all that cool Suspense stuff, but at least it uses hooks :) .\r\n\r\n- https://codesandbox.io/s/heuristic-lake-exxvu\r\n\r\n- https://codesandbox.io/s/magical-grass-016kc\r\n\r\nThe two code sandboxes are essentially identical, the only difference is that the first one (`heuristic-lake-exxvu`) uses a `div` element for `MovieApp`, whereas the second (`magical-grass-016kc`) uses a `React.Fragment` (`<></>`) component:\r\n\r\n`heuristic-lake-exxvu`'s `MovieApp`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst MovieApp = () => {\r\n  const [currentMovie, setCurrentMovie] = useState(initialCurrentMovieState);\r\n  const { isLoading, id: currentMovieId, movieDetails } = currentMovie;\r\n  ...\r\n  return (\r\n    <div> // <======================= Uses a `div`\r\n      {isLoading ? (\r\n        \"Loading...\"\r\n      ) : (\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n`magical-grass-016kc`'s `MovieApp`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst MovieApp = () => {\r\n  const [currentMovie, setCurrentMovie] = useState(initialCurrentMovieState);\r\n  const { isLoading, id: currentMovieId, movieDetails } = currentMovie;\r\n  ...\r\n  return (\r\n    <> // <======================= Uses a fragment\r\n      {isLoading ? (\r\n        \"Loading...\"\r\n      ) : (\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, if you open `heuristic-lake-exxvu` and click on the `Show movie info` button of any movie in the list, you will see the `Loading...` text before the promise with the data of the movie resolves, and the `Movie` component is rendered.\r\n\r\nBefore the promise resolves, try hovering on the `Loading...` text with the `TransOver` extension enabled, you should see:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-11-03 at 23 26 48](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10134421/68093013-764d4800-fe91-11e9-8b64-2dbdade0a500.png)\r\n\r\nThe world makes sense here, no errors, no warnings, everything works.\r\n\r\nNow try to do the same thing on `magical-grass-016kc`, as soon as you hover `Loading...`, you will see the `NotFoundError: Failed to execute 'removeChild' on 'Node'` error logged in the browser's console:\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-11-03 at 23 40 00](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10134421/68093177-49019980-fe93-11e9-9f9b-13f91a12e996.png)\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2019-11-03 at 23 40 52](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10134421/68093194-6df60c80-fe93-11e9-910f-ae748bc9fb91.png)\r\n\r\nHere is a streamable video showing this same error:\r\n\r\nhttps://streamable.com/4gxua\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIn `heuristic-lake-exxvu` (uses a `div` instead of React fragment), everything worked.\r\nThe TransOver extension appends to `body` and does not modify the React's root `div` neither does it append stuff below it, so I would expect the code in the React fragment example (`magical-grass-016kc`) to behave the same and work as in `heuristic-lake-exxvu`.\r\n\r\nChrome is plenty of useful extensions like this one and they should not really interfere with React, I think that users using React applications may also install other extensions which modify the DOM which they find useful.\r\nIf an extension appends to body like TransOver does, I wouldn't expect React to have problems with it and cause undesirable effects and application errors like this one.\r\n\r\nThis is my opinion, I would be very glad to hear what you think about it, and if you think I have spotted a bug of React fragments (I think it's a bug because, again, it works when using a `div` in `heuristic-lake-exxvu`).\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nBrowser: Chrome\r\nReact v16.11.0\r\nReact DOM v16.11.0\r\n\r\n\r\n"

If you setState or something in those events, they should probably behave as if you're already on the new tree.\r\n\r\nSimilarly if we do end up triggering blur/focus events simulated, then those should see the updated tree.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this would fire before life-cycles which is confusing. Although that also happens if you set focus manually on the DOM in a life-cycle too. Triggering a blur after life-cycles could work but needs to take into account that focus can change possibly several times in the life-cycles too.\r\n\r\nRelated to https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/17214"

Each steps depends on the previous one. This is expressed as nested components. The fairly elaborate animated logo is shown for that process, but it's being restarted for each step and the experience is not that nice.\r\n\r\nI've prepared a demo with some experiments: https://codesandbox.io/s/react-suspense-loader-experimental-0ww6i\r\n\r\nThe first one that's active initially is what we currently have. The second is what we would like to have, but with less naive coding of decreasing counter.\r\n\r\nThe last one is my attempt to use Suspense, but I definitely missing something out here, because it behaves very oddly and I cannot seem to figure out why. I wonder if the new `useTransition` should be used somehow or what's going on here."

        "body": "In 16.9.0, a warning was added about `javascript:` URLs. This check is very, very important, as it's incredibly easy to forget about just once place where potential user data is passed onto DOM way. And of course, allowing a javascript: URL to be injected into DOM is a very serious XSS issue.\r\n\r\nI griped before that this is too important to be just a warning, and suggested that a semver-compatible solution is to provide an exported function that allows a runtime opt-in to the new safe behavior. This suggestion was dismissed, since if I want this, I can just make my own build of react with the flag enabled. (Of course, almost no one will do this, because it's just too much of a pain to make your own dependency builds with every release)\r\n\r\nI'd like to make a similar suggestion again. Since Concurrent and Blocking modes are coming soon(ish), and make many breaking changes anyway, why not take this opportunity to also block unsafe javascript: URLs when the mode is enabled? I know that URLs have nothing to do with concurrent mode (unlike unsafe lifecycle methods, etc.), but since many people will want to jump onto this new feature anyway and are willing to deal with some migration required anyway, why not add this vital security precaution as well?\r\n\r\nWaiting until React 17 to protect… well, probably countless React apps that don't properly sanitize URLs, just doesn't seem reasonable, when the feature is already implemented, only disabled under a feature flag.\r\n\r\ncc @gaearon @sebmarkbage "

This is not a problem in se because of the idempotent nature of `render()` (which has to be pure), but makes me think that this is an unneeded call because if an error has been thrown in `render()`, re-executing it right away would still lead to the same exception being thrown.\r\n\r\nOr, is there something I am missing? Maybe related to how React works internally and because of that it needs to recall `render()` as soon as that same `render()` has thrown...\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nOS: OS X\r\nBrowser: Chrome 77\r\nUsing the same React 16 development version of the Pen:\r\n\r\n`https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js`\r\n`https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js`\r\n\r\nThank you for the attention.\r\n"

        "body": "This is a problem i am facing with the [react-three-fiber](https://github.com/drcmda/react-three-fiber), a react renderer for threejs.  The following image is probably a good overview:\r\n\r\n![reconciler](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2223602/67144414-59502c80-f276-11e9-89d1-97496ee10b8c.jpg)\r\n\r\nBasically i have a reconciler, it has a root instance, a scene in my case into which everything's rendered. I keep special information in that scene, which i need when constructing new objects.\r\n\r\nNow, when i use createPortal, like so:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction A() {\r\n  // Create virtual scene\r\n  const virtualScene = useMemo(() => new THREE.Scene(), [])\r\n\r\n  // Render elements into the virtual scene via createPortal\r\n  return createPortal(\r\n    <mesh onClick={() => console.log(\"clicked\")}>\r\n      <meshNormalMaterial attach=\"material\" />\r\n      <boxBufferGeometry attach=\"geometry\" args={[10, 10, 10]} />\r\n    </mesh>\r\n    virtualScene,\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nthen the createInstance inside the reconciler will receive the following:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\ncreateInstance(\r\n  type = \"meshNormalMaterial\",\r\n  props = { attach: \"material\" },\r\n  container = virtualScene,\r\n  hostContext = {},\r\n  internalInstanceHandle = { ... }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem that i face is that i also need to know the root instance into which the portal is rendered, but there seem to be no obvious means to get it. Digging around i noticed that the  internalInstanceHandle fibernode contains it when i traverse it:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst fn = (node: Reconciler.Fiber): THREE.Object3D => {\r\n  if (!node.return) return node.stateNode.containerInfo\r\n  else return fn(node.return)\r\n}\r\nlet scene = fn(internalInstanceHandle) // ---> the root scene\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that seems pretty sketchy. Is there any other way, or could it be exposed?"

When my callback doesn't always do something periodically based on some conditions, it seems that useEffect doesn't quite meet the requirements.\r\n\r\nFor example, using setState data to modify the DOM, and in rare cases, other processing of the DOM will be required in the callback.

        "body": "**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'm trying to write a small `Title` component to render nested document titles. However the kinda unexpected order in which effect clean-up functions are called makes it impossible to do this : \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport { Children, useEffect } from 'react'\r\n\r\nexport default ({ children }) => {\r\n  const subtitle = Children.toArray(children).join('')\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const root = document.title\r\n    document.title = `${subtitle} - ${root}`\r\n    console.log('Wrote', document.title)\r\n    return () => {\r\n      document.title = root\r\n      console.log('Restored', document.title)\r\n    }\r\n  }, [subtitle])\r\n  return null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is a loosy sketch of my component structure (handled with `@reach/router`) : \r\n\r\n```\r\nApp                     // contains <Title>App</Title>\r\n> Dashboard             // contains <Title>Dashboard</Title>\r\n> Profile               // contains <Title>Profile</Title>\r\n> Project               // contains <Title>Project</Title>\r\n  > Calendar            // contains <Title>Calendar</Title>\r\n```\r\n\r\nEach one of these components calls my `Title` component. Everything works fine when going from profile to dashboard or from dashboard to project. But when I jump from calendar to dashboard, the document title gets messed up because the clean-up in Project is called **before** the clean-up in Calendar even though Calendar is a child of Project, which is kinda unexpected and makes tree side-effect logic using (just) `useEffect` simply impossible.\r\n\r\nThe order in which the effect functions are called is a direct reflection of the order in which the components are nested. Shouldn't the clean-up functions be called following the exact reverse order ? Isn't that one of the goals of a clean-up ?\r\n\r\nWhen I navigate to the calendar and then back to the dashboard, I get the following logs : \r\n\r\n```\r\nWrote App\r\nWrote Project - App\r\nWrote Calendar - Project - App\r\nRestored App                          // This should happen after...\r\nRestored Project - App                // ...this.\r\nWrote Dashboard - Project - App       // This is messed up.\r\n```\r\n\r\n[codesandbox here](https://codesandbox.io/s/vigilant-feynman-0jxwb?fontsize=14)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nHere is what I expected and what I would get if clean-ups in children were to be called before clean-ups in parents : \r\n\r\n```\r\nWrote App\r\nWrote Project - App\r\nWrote Calendar - Project - App\r\nRestored Project - App\r\nRestored App\r\nWrote Dashboard - App\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm using React 16.10.2.\r\n\r\nThis ugly workaround works by \"forcing\" the order of what the clean-ups do (by keeping manually track of the effect functions' order and then just going the other way) : \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst stack = []\r\n\r\nexport default ({ children }) => {\r\n  const subtitle = Children.toArray(children).join('')\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    stack.push(document.title)\r\n    document.title = `${subtitle} - ${last(stack)}`\r\n    return () => {\r\n      document.title = stack.pop()\r\n    }\r\n  }, [subtitle])\r\n  return null\r\n}\r\n```"

See:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/react-concurrent-state-bug-sp6zq\r\n\r\nNot an expert on concurrent mode here, was just playing around with it. Noticed that when some interactions happen the work (probably moved to the other tree) gets lost if the parent re-renders. You can see by clicking anywhere in the sandbox page vs clicking on the button that changes some local state. But that is just my educated guess on what might be happening.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nState updates that are scheduled in children components should happen and the DOM value should reflect the state.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

        "body": "It's about the dreaded \"zombie-child\" problem, which is a known problem, but i would still like to open this issue in order to track it. It currently throws a major wrench into our projects at work (which all use mixed reconcilers).\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\n\r\nI consider it a bug.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe long explanation is here: https://kaihao.dev/posts/Stale-props-and-zombie-children-in-Redux\r\n\r\nIn short, when any dispatch, for instance via useState/useReducer.set(...), can cause an _immediate_ render pass, it allows leaf-components to render before their parents. Components that shouldn't even be rendering, because their parents would exclude them, now do render and access data which doesn't exist in the state model any longer. Rendering isn't deterministic and hierarchical any longer.\r\n\r\nDan Abramov acknowledges this behaviour here: https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/959507572951797761\r\n\r\nThe current solution that Sebastian Markbåge suggested is to wrap dispatches into batchedUpdates.\r\n\r\nBut that doesn't work in mixed-mode React, where multiple reconcilers are active. So the same component will work in one reconciler, but crash in another, unless the dispatch is wrapped into each batchedUpdates from each reconciler - which puts the burden onto the consumer of the component and makes the component platform dependent.\r\n\r\nThis problem affects all flex based state managers. Redux for instance. Some fail outright, some do implement batchedUpdates (like Redux), but they will all fail in mixed-mode.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/react-spring/zustand/issues/64\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nAs Dan Abramov himself said on Twitter, any dispatch should be async. But this was in feb 2018. Is there any news regarding this behaviour?\r\n\r\nThe churn outlined in the kaihao.dev article above, just to get simple state management, is almost overwhelming. Its conclusion is \"Our hands are tied, there's no solution yet to be known.\" I know this probably isn't a pressing issue, but i hope it can be prioritized."

        "body": "This feature relates to several new React APIs: concurrent mode, suspense, and server rendering / hydration\r\n\r\n# Background info\r\nWhen hydrating server-rendered content, React starts working on the outermost Suspense boundary and works its way in. During hydration, the server rendered HTML isn't interactive. React records events to replay them once content becomes interactive- (but that doesn't actually happen until React finishes work on the nearest boundary and commits it). React may also reprioritize the order in which boundaries are processed (so that boundaries with pending events get processed sooner).\r\n\r\nThis general process can be hard to reason about and debug, because much of it is not observable visually (beyond some interactions potentially feeling more laggy than expected).\r\n\r\nDevTools already provides some visual overlays (e.g. which elements were rendered by the currently selected Component, [\"highlight updates\"](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16989)). Perhaps DevTools could help here too by visualizing which boundaries in the tree have been hydrated.\r\n\r\n# Visualizing hydration progress\r\n1. When React begins hydrating a new root<sup>1</sup> DevTools will show a visual overlay<sup>2</sup> that covers the entire DOM element container.\r\n1. As React hydrates and commits each new level of Suspense boundaries, DevTools will draw the overlay to only cover the not-yet-hydrated boundaries.\r\n1. Once hydration is completed, all overlays will be cleared<sup>3</sup>.\r\n\r\nThis feature would be opt-in via a new DevTools setting.\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> This suggests a new React-to-DevTools hook to inform DevTools when hydration starts.\r\n\r\n<sup>2</sup> This overlay would nee to be designed. Perhaps some combination of semi-transparent with stripes or bars so that it is high contrast enough to be seen.\r\n\r\n<sup>3</sup> Because the data required to draw these overlays is essentially just a timestamp and a set of rects, some form of replay might be a nice addition.\r\n\r\n# Special cases\r\nIt could be helpful to highlight a couple of special cases by temporarily showing a different style overlay:\r\n\r\n* **Client rendered content inside of a server rendered fallback.** ([This case.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/bb680a09052b5af6543daf28bfcc3283bbc35cf9/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L2030-L2039)) In some cases, the server rendered content may be a forced fallback that gets filled in with client rendered content.\r\n* **React can't complete hydration fast enough to process a client-side update.** ([This case.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/bb680a09052b5af6543daf28bfcc3283bbc35cf9/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberBeginWork.js#L2064-L2074)) In this case, React ends up deleting the server-rendered content and replacing it with client rendered content. For example, a layout effect may set state on an ancestor that updates context. This update is synchronous (because it comes from within a layout effect) so it immediately expires.\r\n\r\nI don't know if the above cases can be reliably detected by DevTools at present. They may require additional information (or an additional React-to-DevTools hook).\r\n\r\nThe following case does **not** need to be highlighted because it is not a deopt:\r\n* **Server rendered content removed before hydration.** In some cases, server rendered content is thrown away before hydration completes because of a user interaction. For example, if the user navigates to a new page before the initial page has finished hydrating."

        "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI initially asked this on Twitter and @gaearon suggested me to open an issue instead.\r\nThe original thread is here: https://twitter.com/sebastienlorber/status/1178328607376232449?s=19\r\nMore easy to read here: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1178328607376232449.html\r\nBut will try to make this issue more clear and structured about my args and questions.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I really like hooks, but wonder if we can't have smarter abstractions and official patterns that make dealing with them more easy for authors and consumers.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\n## Workaround for the stale closure\r\n\r\nAfter using hooks for a while, and being familiar with the stale closure problem, I don't really understand why we need to handle closure dependencies, instead of just doing something like the following code, which always executes latest provided closure (capturing fresh variables)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65869094-f7d52600-e379-11e9-9634-1ab06b41e3ca.png)\r\n\r\nCoupling the dependencies of the closure and the conditions to trigger effect re-execution does not make much sense to me. For me it's perfectly valid to want to capture some variables in the closure, yet when those variables change we don't necessarily want to re-execute.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases where people are using refs to \"stabilize\" some value that should not trigger re-execution, or to access fresh values in closures.\r\n\r\nExamples in major libs includes:\r\n- Formik (code is pretty similar to my \"useSafeEffect\" above): https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/blob/master/src/Formik.tsx#L975\r\n- React-redux, which uses refs to access fresh props: https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/blob/b6b47995acfb8c1ff5d04a31c14aa75f112a47ab/src/components/connectAdvanced.js#L286\r\n\r\nAlso @Andarist (who maintains a few important React libs for a while): \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65872332-9d8b9380-e380-11e9-90b3-bf294991bb82.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWe often find in such codebase the \"useIsomorphicLayoutEffect\" hook which permits to ensure that the ref is set the earliest, and try to avoid the useLayoutEffect warning (see https://gist.github.com/gaearon/e7d97cdf38a2907924ea12e4ebdf3c85). What we are doing here seems unrelated to layout and makes me a bit uncomfortable btw.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Do we need an ESLint rule?\r\n\r\nThe ESLint rule looks to me only useful to avoid the stale closure problem. Without the stale closure problem (which the trick above solves), you can just focus on crafting the array/conditions for effect re-execution and don't need ESLint for that.\r\n\r\nAlso this would make it easier to wrap useEffect in userland without the fear to exposing users to stale closure problem, because eslint plugin won't notice missing dependencies for custom hooks.\r\n\r\nHere's some code for react-navigation (alpha/v5). To me this is weird to have to ask the user to \"useCallback\" just to stabilize the closure of useFocusEffect, just to ensure the effect only runs on messageId change.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65869719-3d462300-e37b-11e9-94d2-5200481588bc.png)\r\n\r\nNot sure to understand why we can't simply use the following instead. For which I don't see the point of using any ESLint rule. I just want the effect to run on messageId change, this is explicit enough for me and there's no \"trap\"\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65869777-564ed400-e37b-11e9-8570-12534e5f2a53.png)\r\n\r\nI've heard that the [React team recommends rather the later](https://twitter.com/satya164/status/1178571088172896256), asking the user to useCallback, instead of building custom hooks taking a dependency array, why exactly? Also heard that the ESLint plugin now was able to detect missing deps in a custom hook, if you add the [hook name to ESLint conf](https://twitter.com/n1rual/status/1178568248062877701). Not, sure what to think we are supposed to do in the end.\r\n\r\n## Are we safe using workarounds?\r\n\r\nIt's still a bit hard for me to be sure which kind of code is \"safe\" regarding React's upcoming features, particularly Concurrent Mode. \r\n\r\nIf I use the `useEffectSafe` above or something equivalent relying on refs, I am safe and future proof?\r\n\r\nIf this is safe, and makes my life easier, why do I have to build this abstraction myself? \r\n\r\nWouldn't it make sense to make this kind of pattern more \"official\" / documented?\r\n\r\nI keep adding this kind of code to every project I work with:\r\n\r\n```tsx \r\nconst useGetter = <S>(value: S): (() => S) => {\r\n  const ref = useRef(value);\r\n  useIsomorphicLayoutEffect(() => {\r\n    ref.current = value;\r\n  });\r\n  return useCallback(() => ref.current, [ref]);\r\n};\r\n```\r\n(including important community projects like [react-navigation-hooks](https://github.com/react-navigation/hooks/blob/master/src/Hooks.ts#L46))\r\n\r\n## Is it a strategy to teach users?\r\n\r\nIs it a choice of the React team to not ship safer abstractions officially and make sure the users hit the closure problem early and get familiar with it? \r\n\r\nBecause anyway, even when using getters, we still can't prevent the user to capture some value. This has been documented by @sebmarkbage [here](https://gist.github.com/sebmarkbage/a5ef436427437a98408672108df01919) with async code, even with a getter, we can't prevent the user to do things like:\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nonMount(async () => {\r\n  let isEligible = getIsEligible();\r\n  let data = await fetch(...);\r\n  // at this point, isEligible might has changed: we should rather use `getIsEligible()` again instead of storing a boolean in the closure (might depend on the usecase though, but maybe we can imagine isEligible => isMounted)\r\n  if (isEligible) {\r\n    doStuff(data);\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```  \r\nAs far as I understand, this might be the case:\r\n\r\n> So you can easily get into the same situation even with a mutable source value. React just makes you always deal with it so that you don't get too far down the road before you have to refactor you code to deal with these cases anyway. I'm really glad how well the React community has dealt with this since the release of hooks because it really sets us up to predictably deal with more complex scenario and for doing more things in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n## A concrete problem\r\n\r\nA react-navigation-hooks user reported that his effect run too much, using the following code:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65870979-bf374b80-e37d-11e9-8a6c-1f7df8503c18.png)\r\n\r\nIn practice, this is because react-navigation core does not provide stable `navigate` function, and thus the hooks too. The core does not necessarily want to \"stabilize\" the navigate function and guarantee that contract in its API.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me what should I do, between officially stabilizing the `navigate` function in the hooks project (relying on core, so core can still return distinct navigate functions), or if I should ask the user to stabilize the function himself in userland, leading to pain and boilerplate for many users trying to use the API.\r\n\r\nI don't understand why you can't simply dissociate the closure dependencies to the effect's triggering, and simply omitting the `navigate` function here:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/749374/65871264-51d7ea80-e37e-11e9-837d-291775853b2e.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat bothers me is that somehow as hooks lib authors we now have to think about whether what we return to the user is stable or not, ie safe to use in an effect dependency array without unwanted effect re-executions.\r\n\r\nReturning a stable value in v1 and unstable in v2 is a breaking change that might break users apps in nasty ways, and we have to document this too in our api doc, or ask the user to not trust us, and do the memoization work themselves, which is quite error prone and verbose. Now as lib authors we have to think not only about the inputs/outputs, but also about preserving identities or not (it's probably not a new problem, because we already need to in userland for optimisations anyway).\r\n\r\nAsking users to do this memoization themselves is error prone and verbose. And intuitively some people will maybe want to `useMemo` (just because of the naming) which actually can tricks them by not offering the same guarantees than `useCallback`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## A tradeoff between different usecases in the name of a consistent API?\r\n\r\n@satya164 also mentionned that there are also usecases where the [ESLint plugin saved him](https://twitter.com/satya164/status/1178395620236759043) more than once because he forgot some dependency, and for him, it's more easy to fix an effect re-executing too much than to find out about some cached value not updating. \r\n\r\nI see how the ESLint plugin is really handy for usecases such as building a stable object to optimize renders or provide a stable context value. \r\n\r\nBut for useEffect, when capturing functions, sometimes executing 2 functions with distinct identities actually lead to the same result. Having to add those functions to dependencies is quite annoying in such case. \r\n\r\nBut I totally understand we want to guarantee some kind of consistency across all hooks API.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nI try to understand some of the tradeoffs being made in the API. Not sure to understand yet the whole picture, and I'm probably not alone. \r\n\r\n@gaearon said to open an issue with a comment: `It's more nuanced`. I'm here to discuss all the nuances if possible :)\r\n\r\nWhat particularly bothers me currently is not necessarily the existing API. It's rather:\r\n- the dogmatism of absolutely wanting to conform the ESLint rules (for which I don't agree with for all usecases). Currently I think users are really afraid to not follow the rules.\r\n- the lack of official patterns on how we are supposed to handle some specific hooks cases. And I think the \"getter\" pattern should be a thing that every hooks users know about and learn very early. Eventually adding such pattern in core would make it even more visible. Currently it's more lib authors and tech leads that all find out about this pattern in userland with small implementation variations.\r\n\r\nThose are the solutions that I think of. As I said I may miss something important and may change my opinions according to the answers.\r\n\r\nAs an author of a few React libs, I feel a bit frustrated to not be 100% sure what kind of API contract I should offer to my lib's users. I'm also not sure about the hooks patterns I can recommend or not. I plan to open-source something soon but don't even know if that's a good idea, and if it goes in the direction the React team want to go with hooks.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This works well on smaller sites, or in a situation where your company may have a monorepo and can enforce and track these warnings.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIn addition to this behavior, it would be beneficial to React developers if they could have ESLint plugins that had rules for these warnings. Ideally, the ESLint plugin could fix simple cases (methods being renamed) and in more complex cases recommend a codemod.\r\n\r\n——-\r\n\r\nI’m posting this here as per discussion with @acdlite on twitter. See this thread: https://twitter.com/acdlite/status/1178018850937290753?s=21\r\n\r\nUltimately, it is harder for shops that do micro frontends to ensure everyone is compliant with new React versions. It is also easier to catch things early at build time then to dig around in the browser runtime when there may be other compounding issues.\r\n\r\nThe other benefit of this would be that it would enable third party libraries to potentially have “day 1 support” for new major React versions because they could follow the rule set and ensure that they are forwards compatible without being caught trying to do it all at once.\r\n\r\nLastly, I’m happy to help drive/contribute to any rule set to make sure it works in our use case.\r\n"

The rationale for that is to know up front if the upcoming version of React is going to break our library. I think this is good practice for everyone involved.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when 16.9 was released, there was only 1 week between promoting the RC to `@next`, and promoting that to `@latest`. Because the last RC broke the way `act` works, I had only 1 week to fix our unit test suite, which was all the sudden mostly failing. In fact we had to wait for `react-testing-library` to be updated to deal with this change.\r\n\r\nLuckily I was able to scramble and find time to fix this before the final release, but this won't always be the case. I imagine other library authors may struggle with this too. As such I would like to see at least a 2 week window between `next` and `latest`. I hope that's feasible.\r\n\r\nPlease advise if there's a better way to test for future compatibility."

I guess that this \"sometimes\" is because if the event is fired before the client side hydration. Is not catched by my JS. And the `e => e.target.src = fallbackSrc` is never executed. However, if the JS is loaded faster than the onError event, is catched, and is rendering the fallback image as I expected.\r\n\r\nI want to propose some utility to do sometimes some exceptions, and render the JS inline on the first render.

The challenge is that these definitions are all globally scoped. It's fairly easy to get around this by prefixing these definitions with an id that is stable and unique to the component instance:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nimport { useMemo, ReactElement } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nfunction gen(): string {\r\n  return Math.random()\r\n    .toString(36)\r\n    .substr(2, 5);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction useUniqueId(): string {\r\n  return useMemo(gen, []);\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction SomeComponent(): ReactElement {\r\n  const id = useUniqueId();\r\n  return (\r\n    <svg>\r\n      <defs>\r\n        <circle id={`${id}-myCircle`} cx=\"0\" cy=\"0\" r=\"5\" />\r\n      </defs>\r\n\r\n      <use x=\"5\" y=\"5\" xlink:href={`#${id}-myCircle`} fill=\"red\" />\r\n    </svg>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this works well, the generated ID is different each time a component is instantiated. This means that it's not possible to safely rehydrate server-rendered SVGs, as the HTML will have the wrong prefix.\r\n\r\nInstead, I would like a hook that provides the react path to the current component. For example:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction SomeComponent(): ReactElement {\r\n  const path = useReactPath();\r\n  return <pre>{JSON.stringify(path, null, 2)}</pre>\r\n}\r\n\r\n// somewhere else:\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n  <div>Foo</div>\r\n  <div>{[\r\n    <div key=\"bar\">Bar</div>,\r\n    <div key=\"baz\">\r\n      Baz\r\n      <SomeComponent />\r\n    </div>\r\n  ]}</div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe would expect the path to be:\r\n```js\r\n[\r\n  1,     // after the <div>Foo</div> block\r\n  0,     // the interpolation block\r\n  \"baz\", // the array specifies keys\r\n  1      // after the Baz text block\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis array could then be used much like an XPath for testing automation purposes, or hashed into a unique ID or prefix, for purposes like mine.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nThis has never been possible.\r\n"

In server.js, I created a dedicated route to handle /app-shell URL.  \r\n\r\n   ```javascript\r\n   server.get('/app-shell', (request, response) => {\r\n  \tresponse.set('content-type', 'text/html');\r\n\tresponse.write(`<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n\t     … \r\n            <body>\r\n               <div id=\"root\"></div>\r\n               <script src=\"js/client.js\"></script>\r\n               <script src=\"js/vendor.js\"></script>\r\n              <script>\r\n                 if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {\r\n                    window.addEventListener('load', () => {\r\n                   navigator.serviceWorker\r\n                  .register('/service-worker.js', { scope: '/' })\r\n                  .then((registration) => {\r\n                      console.log('ServiceWorker registration successful with scope: ', registration.scope);\r\n                })\r\n                .catch((registrationError) => {\r\n                    console.log('SW registration failed: ', registrationError);   \r\n                });\r\n            });\r\n          }\r\n         </script>\r\n      </body>\t\t\r\n       `);\r\n   });  \r\n   ```\r\n2. Second approach, I created a route /app-shell which corresponds to an element with content “Loading…”.  \r\n\r\n  ```javascript\r\n   const AppShellComponent: React.FC<{}> = (): JSX.Element => (\r\n  \t<main>\r\n   \t     Loading...\r\n        </main>\r\n  );\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n  In both cases, I get the above mismatch warning. If I make AppShellComponent exactly same as HomeComponent i.e. path /, then the error goes away if the app is invoked from the home page path i.e. / . However, if any other route is invoked, the warning comes back again. Please suggest a better approach. Thanks.\r\n"

          "body": "(This is a spinoff from [this thread](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/15240).)\r\n\r\nIt's sometimes useful to be able to dispatch an action from within an async function, wait for the action to transform the state, and then use the resulting state to determine possible further async work to do. For this purpose it's possible to define a `useNext` hook which returns a promise of the next value:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction useNext(value) {\r\n  const valueRef = useRef(value);\r\n  const resolvesRef = useRef([]);\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (valueRef.current !== value) {\r\n      for (const resolve of resolvesRef.current) {\r\n        resolve(value);\r\n      }\r\n      resolvesRef.current = [];\r\n      valueRef.current = value;\r\n    }\r\n  }, [value]);\r\n  return () => new Promise(resolve => {\r\n    resolvesRef.current.push(resolve);\r\n  });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand use it like so:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst nextState = useNext(state);\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  fetchStuff(state);\r\n}, []);\r\n\r\nasync function fetchStuff(state) {\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'START_LOADING' });\r\n  \r\n  let data = await xhr.post('/api/data');\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'RECEIVE_DATA', data });\r\n  \r\n  // get the new state after the action has taken effect\r\n  state = await nextState();\r\n\r\n  if (!state.needsMoreData) return;\r\n\r\n  data = await xhr.post('/api/more-data');\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'RECEIVE_MORE_DATA', data });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is all well and good, but `useNext` has a fundamental limitation: it only resolves promises when the state _changes_... so if dispatching an action resulted in the same state (thus causing `useReducer` to [bail out](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#bailing-out-of-a-state-update)), our async function would hang waiting for an update that wasn't coming.\r\n\r\nWhat we _really_ want here is a way to obtain the state after the last dispatch has taken effect, whether or not it resulted in the state changing. Currently I'm not aware of a foolproof way to implement this in userland (happy to be corrected on this point). But it seems like it could be a very useful feature of `useReducer`'s `dispatch` function itself to return a promise of the state resulting from reducing by the action. Then we could rewrite the preceding example as\r\n\r\n```js\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  fetchStuff(state);\r\n}, []);\r\n\r\nasync function fetchStuff(state) {\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'START_LOADING' });\r\n  \r\n  let data = await xhr.post('/api/data');\r\n  state = await dispatch({ type: 'RECEIVE_DATA', data });\r\n  \r\n  if (!state.needsMoreData) return;\r\n\r\n  data = await xhr.post('/api/more-data');\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'RECEIVE_MORE_DATA', data });\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## EDIT\r\n\r\nThinking about this a little more, the promise returned from `dispatch` doesn't need to carry the next state, because there are other situations where you want to obtain the latest state too and we can already solve that with a simple ref. The narrowly-defined problem is: we need to be able to wait until after a `dispatch()` has taken affect. So `dispatch` could just return a `Promise<void>`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst stateRef = useRef(state);\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  stateRef.current = state;\r\n}, [state]);\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  fetchStuff();\r\n}, []);\r\n\r\nasync function fetchStuff() {\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'START_LOADING' });\r\n  \r\n  let data = await xhr.post('/api/data');\r\n\r\n  // can look at current state here too\r\n  if (!stateRef.current.shouldReceiveData) return;\r\n  \r\n  await dispatch({ type: 'RECEIVE_DATA', data });\r\n\r\n  if (!stateRef.current.needsMoreData) return;\r\n\r\n  data = await xhr.post('/api/more-data');\r\n  dispatch({ type: 'RECEIVE_MORE_DATA', data });\r\n}\r\n```"

In short, there is a [Reaction object being created](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-lite/blob/231be100e6ba458f40642adb9f0bc77aa4d366ce/src/useObserver.ts#L32\r\n) to track for observables and it is stored within `useRef`.\r\n\r\nThe major problem is, that we can't just `useEffect` to create it in a safe way later. We need it to start tracking the observables on a first render otherwise we might miss some updates and cause inconsistent behavior.\r\n\r\nWe do have a [semi-working solution](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-lite/pull/121), basically, a custom made garbage collector based on `setTimeout`. However, it's unreliable as it can accidentally dispose of Reactions that are actually being used but weren't committed yet.\r\n\r\nWould love to hear we are overlooking some obvious solution there."

Because of the `componentDidCatch` in `ErrorHandler` we can go on the render phase. But when we reach the `StatefulComponent` we got `useMemo` as `workInProgressHook` and it make `StatefulComponent` with first hook `useMemo`.\r\n\r\nI guess we can fix this just set `workInProgressHook` to null at the beginning of `renderWithHooks`. I post this issue because I see this comment in `renderWithHooks`, based on this example, all this variables may also not be reset when start `renderWithHooks`, so maybe it's better to put them back?\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// The following should have already been reset\r\n  // currentHook = null;\r\n  // workInProgressHook = null;\r\n\r\n  // remainingExpirationTime = NoWork;\r\n  // componentUpdateQueue = null;\r\n\r\n  // didScheduleRenderPhaseUpdate = false;\r\n  // renderPhaseUpdates = null;\r\n  // numberOfReRenders = 0;\r\n  // sideEffectTag = 0;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf no other concerns about this, I just want to put them back to fix this issue.\r\n"

          "body": "In out team we encountered a explosive discussion on how we should handle the relationship of a fetch and its parameters, after searching in community I still find various solutions to this, I'd like to raise this discussion to find a best practive.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nSuppose we have a simple list view like:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"687\" alt=\"Jietu20190402-130206@2x\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/639549/55377435-87268b80-5547-11e9-97a8-313a5713ced3.png\">\r\n\r\nWhenever user types keyword in textbox and clicks \"Search\" button, or they change the page number, we should fetch a new list from remote and render it in table.\r\n\r\nWe use redux to manage global state of this simple app, the store is structured as:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{\r\n    filter: '',\r\n    pageIndex: 0,\r\n    results: []\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe developed a total of 3 solutions to demonstrate how the change of `filter` and `pageIndex` should cause a fetch of `results`.\r\n\r\n## Use effect and separation of view and logic\r\n\r\nThis is the first demo: https://codesandbox.io/s/20x1m39w00\r\n\r\nIn this implementation we tried to:\r\n\r\n1. Utilize `useEffect` to trigger a fetch when any parameter changes.\r\n2. Do not pass any parameter as prop to `components/List` component.\r\n\r\nIn my point of view, I like this solution best because:\r\n\r\n1. It have a very clear separation of view and logic, `components/List` does not receive any redundant props such as `filter` or `pageIndex`.\r\n2. It theoretically treat a callback prop as a normal one, make it a dependency of `useEffect`.\r\n3. It works in a **reactive** way, which means \"we trigger a fetch not because the action taken from user, only because the change of state\".\r\n\r\nStill we have concerns about it:\r\n\r\n1. It obviously triggers more render and updates because change of `filter` or `pageIndex` does not dispatch `FETCH_RESULTS` immediately, this cause a sync dispatch in effect which we previously avoided by `no-set-state-did-update` rule.\r\n2. We create a state update from another state update, this \"chaining\" is not clear enough for developers and may cause unwanted infinite loop.\r\n\r\n## Use effect and params together\r\n\r\nThe second demo is much like the first one: https://codesandbox.io/s/54o1rjvyv4\r\n\r\nThe only change is we pass `filter` and `pageIndex` to `components/List`, in this case we believe **effect is a part of component** so that every dependencies used to form an effect should be passed as prop.\r\n\r\nThis solution gives a more clear view of what is used to fetch data in `components/List`, this is \r\n a highly adopted solution in community, however we're not sure this is recommended officially.\r\n\r\n## Imperative action to fetch data\r\n\r\nAs opposed to previous, this is our third demo: https://codesandbox.io/s/p5yv48x97x\r\n\r\nIn this solution we changed our thought and implement the app in a more \"redux way\":\r\n\r\n1. We trigger the fetch on user interactions, either click on \"Search\" button or change the page number, however either interaction only provides its own parameter, we don't provide `pageIndex` when \"Search\" button is clicked.\r\n2. We have a thunk which computes a new parameter object based on current state using `getState()` function, a `FETCH_RESULTS` action is dispatched.\r\n3. We have several reducers to observe `FETCH_RESULTS` action and updates corresponding parameter in global state.\r\n4. Fetched list is connected to `components/List` component, this component now is a pure presentational component, no lifecycle effect is involved.\r\n5. To solve the first fetch when application is mounted, we create an `containers/App` container component.\r\n\r\nBy doing these we eliminated the \"chaining state update\" issue, however it introduces several concerns:\r\n\r\n1. If we add more user interactions in the future, the `loadResults` thunk could be more and more complex.\r\n2. The use of `getState` in `redux-thunk` is not highly recommended in community, we found some articles stating that developers should avoid to use it in most cases.\r\n3. We can't explain the exist of the `containers/App` container only to trigger a fetch on mount, thee `useEffect` take no dependencies and `exhaustive-deps` rules complains about it, not paring mount and update is also a big uncomfortable point to us.\r\n4. Trigger fetch from user interactions is what we called \"imperative\", we're confused about whether a reactive framework like react recommends imperative programming.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nSince we are not able to get a conclusion for a very long time, we decide to raise this issue for more discussion to find a better solution to these very common use cases."

In the future, React may choose to “forget” some previously memoized values and recalculate them on next render, e.g. to free memory for offscreen components. Write your code so that it still works without useMemo — and then add it to optimize performance.

(I'll call them effect functions for short)\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nSee [this enzyme issue](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme/issues/1938#issuecomment-476137018) for more details about where this request is coming from. But the general idea is that it is often nice to run effect functions even when shallow rendering, rather than having to use full rendering on those specific tests. \r\n\r\nIf the shallow renderer provided an option to run the effect functions, it would allow people who test with shallow rendering to more easily test their components. Enzyme currently supports this in class components by calling componentDidUpdate/mount directly on the component instance, but this would be a much harder thing to do for hooks, since they are usually anonymous.\r\n\r\nEnzyme used to not allow this at all, but then added an option to turn on this behavior in their shallow renderer, before finally turning it on by default and then adding an option to turn it off. It didn't seem to cause too many issues for them, so I think this approach could work well for the React shallow renderer as well. Obviously I'm only asking for an option to turn it on now, not to change the default or anything.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nAll and no it was never supported AFAIK"

          "body": "I started this as a gist but Dan mentioned that this would be a good discussion issue so here goes. I've been writing with and refactoring code into hooks for a while now. For 95% of code, they are great and very straight-forward once you get the basic idea. There are still a few more complex cases where I struggle with the right answer though. This is an attempt to explain them.\r\n\r\n## The use case\r\n\r\nThis is a real-world use case from an app I'm building: interacting with a list items. I've simplified the examples into codesandboxes though to illustrate the basic idea.\r\n\r\nHere's the first one: https://codesandbox.io/s/lx55q0v3qz. It renders a list of items, and if you click on any of them, an editable input will appear to edit it (it doesn't save yet). The colored box on the right will change whenever an item rerenders.\r\n\r\nIf you click around in the items, you can see that when changing the edited item, all items rerender. But the `Row` component is wrapped with `React.memo`! They all rerender because the `onEdit` is new each time the app renders, causing all items to rerender.\r\n\r\n## Maintaining callback identity\r\n\r\nWe want `onEdit` to be same function for all future renders. In this case, it's easy because it doesn't depend on anything. We can simply wrap it in `useCallback` with an empty dependencies array:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  let onEdit = useCallback(id => {\r\n    setEditingId(id);\r\n  }, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, you can see clicking around only rerenders the necessary items (only those colors change): https://codesandbox.io/s/k33klz68yr\r\n\r\n## Implementing saving\r\n\r\nWe're missing a crucial feature: after editing an item, on blur it should save the value. In my app the way the \"save\" event gets triggered is different, but doing it on blur is fine here.\r\n\r\nTo do this, we create an `onSave` callback in the app and pass it down to each item, which calls it on blur with the new value. `onSave` takes a new item and updates the items array with the new item and sets the `items` state.\r\n\r\nHere is it running: https://codesandbox.io/s/yvl79qj5vj\r\n\r\nYou'll notice that all items are rerendering again when saving. The list rerenders twice when you click another item: first when you click down and the input loses focus, and then again to edit a different item. So all the colors change once, and then only the editing rows color changes again.\r\n\r\nThe reason all of them are rerendering is because `onSave` is now a new callback every render. But we can't fix it with the same technique as `onEdit` because it depends on `items` - so we *have* to create a new callback which closes over `items` otherwise you'd lose previous edits. This is the \"callbacks are recreated too many times\" problem with hooks.\r\n\r\nOne solution is to switch to `useReducer`. Here's that implementation:\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/nrq5y77kj0\r\n\r\nNote that I still wrap up the reducer into `onEdit` and `onSave` callbacks that are passed down to the row. I find passing callbacks to be clearer in most cases, and works with any components in the ecosystem that already expect callbacks. We can simply use `useCallback` with no dependencies though since `dispatch` is always the same.\r\n\r\nNote how that even when saving an item, only the necessary rows rerender.\r\n\r\n## The difference between event handlers and dispatch\r\n\r\nThere's a problem though. This works with a simple demo, but in my real app `onSave` *both* optimistically updates local state and saves it off to the server. It does a side effect.\r\n\r\nIt's something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync function onSave(transaction) {\r\n  let { changes, newTransactions } = updateTransaction(transactions, transaction);\r\n  // optimistic update\r\n  setTransactions(newTransactions)\r\n  // save to server\r\n  await postToServer('apply-changes', { changes })\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's a big difference between the phase when an event handler and dispatch is run. Event handlers are run whenever they are triggered (naturally) but the dispatching the action (running `reducer`) happens when rendering. The reducer must be pure because of this.\r\n\r\nHere's the reducer from https://codesandbox.io/s/nrq5y77kj0:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  function reducer(state, action) {\r\n    switch (action.type) {\r\n      case \"save-item\": {\r\n        let { item } = action;\r\n        return {\r\n          ...state,\r\n          items: items.map(it => (it.id === item.id ? item : it))\r\n        };\r\n      }\r\n      case \"edit-item\": {\r\n        return { ...state, editingId: action.id };\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow is `save-item` also supposed to trigger a side effect? First, item's important to understand these 3 phases:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEvent handler -> render -> commit\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvents are run in the first phase, which causes a render (when dispatches happen), and when everything is finally ready to be flushed to the DOM it does it in a \"commit\" phase, which is when all effects are run (more or less).\r\n\r\nWe need our side effect to run in the commit phase.\r\n\r\n### Option 1\r\n\r\nOne option is to use a ref to \"mark\" the saving effect to be run. Here's the code: https://codesandbox.io/s/m5xrrm4ym8\r\n\r\nBasically you create a flag as a ref:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet shouldSave = useRef(false);\r\n```\r\n\r\nLuckily, we've already wrapped the save dispatch into an event handler. Inside `onSave` we mark this flag as true. We can't do it inside of the reducer because it must be pure:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  let onSave = useCallback(item => {\r\n    shouldSave.current = true;\r\n    dispatch({ type: \"save-item\", item });\r\n  }, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\nFinally, we define an effect that always runs after rendering and checks the flag and resets it:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    if (shouldSave.current) {\r\n      // save... all the items to the server?\r\n      post(items)\r\n      shouldSave.current = false;\r\n    }\r\n  });\r\n```\r\n\r\nI thought this option was going to work, but just ran into this issue. We don't know *what* to save anymore. We certainly don't want to send the entire items array to the server! I suppose we could store the item in the ref, but what happens if multiple events are fired before the effect runs? I suppose you could store an array, but... do we really need that?\r\n\r\n### Option 2\r\n\r\n**Note**: I just noticed this option is documented in [How to read an often-changing value from useCallback?](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-read-an-often-changing-value-from-usecallback), but I disagree with the tone used. I think this is a fine pattern an better in many cases than `dispatch`, even if it's not quite as robust. Especially since it's not as powerful as callbacks. (see end of this section)\r\n\r\nKeeping around all of the data we need to do the effect might work in some cases, but it feels a little clunky. If we could \"queue up\" effect from the reducer, that would work, but we can't do that. Instead, another option is to embrace callbacks.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the version which used a naive `onSave` which forced all items to rerender (https://codesandbox.io/s/yvl79qj5vj), `onSave` looks like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n  let onSave = useCallback(\r\n    item => {\r\n      setItems(items.map(it => (it.id === item.id ? item : it)));\r\n    },\r\n    [items]\r\n  );\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe core problem is that it depends on items. We need to recreate `onSave` because it closes over `items`. But what if it didn't close over it? Instead, let's create a ref:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet latestItems = useRef(items);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd an effect which keeps it up-to-date with items:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  latestItems.current = items\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, the `onSave` callback can reference the ref to always get the up-to-date items. Which means we can memoize it with `useCallback`:\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet onSave = useCallback(item => {\r\n  setItems(latestItems.current.map(it => (it.id === item.id ? item : it)));\r\n}, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe are **intentionally** opting to always referencing the latest item. The biggest change with hooks in my opinion is that they are safe by default: an async function will always reference the exact same state that existed at the time they were called. Classes operate the other way: you access state from this.state which can be mutated between async work. Sometimes you want that though so you can maintain callback identity.\r\n\r\nHere is the running sandbox for it: https://codesandbox.io/s/0129jop840. Notice how you can edit items and only the necessary rows rerender, even though it updates `items`. Now, we can do anything we want in our callback, like posting to a server:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet onSave = useCallback(item => {\r\n  setItems(latestItems.current.map(it => (it.id === item.id ? item : it)));\r\n  // save to server\r\n  post('/save-item', { item })\r\n}, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, if all you need is the latest data since last commit, **callbacks can be memoized as well as reducers**. The drawback is that you need to put each piece of data you need in a ref. If you have lots of pieces of data and only a few simple effects, reducers would be better, but in my case (and I suspect in many others) it's easier to use callbacks with refs.\r\n\r\nIt's nice too because in my real app the save process is more complicated. It needs to get changes back from the server and apply them locally as well, so it looks more like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet onSave = useCallback(item => {\r\n  setItems(latestItems.current.map(it => (it.id === item.id ? item : it)));\r\n  // save to server\r\n  let changes = await post('/save-item', { item })\r\n  applyChanges(latestItems.current, changes)\r\n}, []);\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaintainability-wise, it's *really* nice to see this whole flow here in one place. Breakin this up to try to manually queue up effects and do a dance with `useReducer` feels much more convoluted.\r\n\r\n### Option 3\r\n\r\nI suppose another option would be to try to \"mark\" the effect to be run in state itself. That way you could do it in `useReducer` as well, and it would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\r\n  switch (action.type) {\r\n    case \"save-item\": {\r\n      let { item } = action;\r\n      return {\r\n        ...state,\r\n        items: state.items.map(it => (it.id === item.id ? item : it)),\r\n        itemsToSave: itemsToSave.concat([item])\r\n      };\r\n    }\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd an effect would check the `itemsToSave` state and save them off. The problem is resetting that state - the effect would have to change state, causing a useless rerender, and it's not determistic to make sure that the effect does not run multiple times before `itemsToSave` gets reset.\r\n\r\nIn my experience mixing effects into state, causing renders, make things a lot more difficult to maintain and debug.\r\n\r\n### What's the difference between Option 1 and 2?\r\n\r\nIs there a crucial difference between 1 and 2? Yes, but I'd argue it's not a big deal if you can accept it. Remember these three phases:\r\n\r\n```\r\nEvent handler -> render -> commit\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe big difference is option 1 is doing the side effect in the commit phase, and option 2 is doing it in the event handler phase. Why does this matter?\r\n\r\nIf, for some reason, an item called `onSave` multiple times before the next commit phase happened, option 1 is more robust. A reducer will \"queue up\" the actions and run them in order, updating state in between them, so if you did:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nonSave({ id: 1, name: \"Foo\" })\r\nonSave({ id: 2, name: \"Bar\" })\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich runs the callback twice immediately, the reducer will process the first save and update the items, and process the second save **passing in the already updated state**.\r\n\r\nHowever, with option 2, when processing the second save **the commit phase hasn't been run yet** so the `latestItems` ref hasn't been updated yet. **The first save will be lost**.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ergonomics of option 2 is much better for many use cases, and I think it's fine to weight these benefits and never need the ability to handle such quick updates. Although concurrent mode might introduce some interesting arguments against that.\r\n\r\n## Another small use case for triggering effects\r\n\r\nIn case this wasn't already long enough, there's a similar use case I'll describe quickly. You can also add new items to the list by editing data in an empty row, and the state of this \"new item\" is tracked separately. \"Saving\" this item doesn't touch the backend, but simply updates the local state, and separate explicit \"add\" action is needed to add it to the list.\r\n\r\nThe hard part is that there is a keybinding for adding the item to the list while editing - something like alt+enter. The problem is I want to coordinate with the state change, so first I want to save the existing field and *then* add to the list. The saving process is complicated so it need to run through that first (I can't just duplicate it all in `onAdd`).\r\n\r\nThis isn't a problem specific to hooks, it's just about coordinating with state changes. When I was working with reducers, I had though that something like this would be neat. Basically when the new items detect that you want to save + add it first an action like `{ type: 'save-item', fields: { name: 'Foo' }, shouldAdd: true }`\r\n\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction reducer(state, action) {\r\n  switch (action.type) {\r\n    case \"save-item\": {\r\n      let { fields } = action;\r\n      let newItem = { ...state.newItem, ...fields };\r\n\r\n      if(action.shouldAdd) {\r\n        shouldAdd.current = true\r\n      }\r\n\r\n      return { ...state, newItem };\r\n    }\r\n    // ...\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `shouldAdd` is a ref that is checked on commit phase and saves the item off to the server. This isn't possible though.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be for the item to call `onAdd` instead of `onSave` when saving + adding, and you could manually call the reducer yourself to process the changes:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nasync function onAdd(fields) {\r\n  let action = { type: 'save-item', fields }\r\n  dispatch(action)\r\n  \r\n  let newItem = reducer(state, action)\r\n  post('/add-item', { newItem });\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is kind of a neat trick: you are manually running the reducer to get the updated state, and React will run the reducer again whenever it wants.\r\n\r\nSince I ended up liking callbacks for my original problems, I ended up going with a similar approach where I have a ref flag that I just set in `onSave`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet [newItem, setNewItem] = useState({})\r\nlet latestNewItem = useRef(newItem);\r\nlet shouldAdd = useRef(false);\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  latestNewItem.current = newItem;\r\n})\r\n\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  if(shouldAdd.current) {\r\n    setNewItem({})\r\n    post('/add-item', { newItem })\r\n    shouldAdd.current = false;\r\n  }\r\n})\r\n\r\nlet onSave = useCallback((fields, { add }) => {\r\n  // In my real app, applying the changes to the current item is a bit more complicated than this,\r\n  // so it's not an option to separate on an `onAdd` function that duplicates this logic\r\n  setNewItem({ ...latestNewItem.current, ...fields });\r\n\r\n  // This action also should add, mark the effect to be run\r\n  if(add) {\r\n    shouldAdd.current = true;\r\n  }\r\n}, [])\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Conclusions\r\n\r\nSorry for the length of this. I figure I'd be over-detailed rather than under-detailed, and I've been brewing these thoughts since hooks came out. I'll try to conclude my thoughts here:\r\n\r\n* Effects are **very nice**. It feels like we have easy access to the \"commit\" phase of React, whereas previously it was all in `componentDidUpdate` and not composable at all. Now it's super easy to throw on code to the commit phase which makes coordinating stuff with state easier.\r\n\r\n* Reducers have interesting properties, and I can see how they are fully robust in a concurrent world, but for many cases they are too limited. The ergonomics of implementing many effect-ful workflows with them requires an awkward dance, kind of like when you try to track effect states in local state and split up workflows. Keeping a linear workflow in a callback is not only nice, but necessary in many cases for maintainability.\r\n\r\n* Callbacks can be made memoizable without much work. In many cases I think it's easier to use the ref trick than reducers, but the question is: just *how* dangerous is it? Right now it's not that dangerous, but maybe concurrent mode really is going to break it.\r\n\r\n* If that's the case, we should figure out a better way to weave together effects and state changes.\r\n\r\nI hope all of this made sense. Let me know if something is unclear and I'll try to fix it."

Of course this was a bug introduced by myself, but if I had been in a pay-as-you-go plan it could have cost me some money. I now use a custom hook as useEffect, which counts in development whether a hook is executed too often in 500ms and if so, it throws an error.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nI'm not sure how you could solve this on your side. Of course you could do the check in development-mode, but that would probably trigger existing projects too much. However, a small hint in the documentation would be good that you should take care during development that useEffect can quickly lead to this behavior and that you should be careful when using other 3rd-party services that have a quota or have to be paid.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to share my experiences while developing a \"real\" app. If you can't or won't do anything here, you are welcome to close the issue."

          "body": "At the time React added callback refs the main use case for them was to replace string refs. A lot of the callback refs looked like this:\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<div ref={node => this.node = node} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the introduction of `createRef` and `useRef` this use case is pretty much replaced by these alternatives so the use case of callback refs will shift to advanced use cases like [measuring DOM nodes](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-can-i-measure-a-dom-node).\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if you could return a cleanup function from the callback ref which is called instead of the callback with null. This way it will behave more like the `useEffect` API.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<div ref={node => {\r\n  // Normal ref callback\r\n\r\n  return () => {\r\n    // Cleanup function which is called when the ref is removed\r\n  }\r\n}} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will be super helpful when you need to set up a Resize-, Intersection- or  MutationObserver.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction useDimensions() {\r\n  const [entry, setEntry] = useState()\r\n  \r\n  const targetRef = useCallback((node) => {\r\n    const observer = new ResizeObserver(([entry]) => {\r\n      setEntry(entry)\r\n    })\r\n\r\n    observer.observe(node)\r\n\r\n    return () => {\r\n      observer.disconnect()\r\n    }\r\n  }, [])\r\n\r\n  return [entry, targetRef]\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Comp() {\r\n  const [dimensions, targetRef] = useDimensions()\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <pre ref={targetRef}>\r\n      {JSON.stringify(dimensions, null, 2)}\r\n    </pre>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you want to implement something like this you need to save the observer into a ref and then if the callback ref is called with null you have to clean up the observer from the ref.\r\n\r\nTo be 99% backward compatible we could call both the callback ref with null and the cleanup function. The only case where it isn't backward compatible is if currently someone is returning a function and doesn't expect the function to be called.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nfunction ref(node) {\r\n  if (node === null) {\r\n    return\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Do something\r\n\r\n  return () => {\r\n    // Cleanup something\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```"

We can autofix it to infer deps if needed, or autofix to remove the hook altogether if there no deps needed (according to https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usememo, if no second argument is provided it behaves as if the hook doesn't exist anyways).\r\n\r\nWhat would be the best way to implement this autofix? In my opinion, linting shouldn't be breaking functionality on an autofix, so autofixing to remove the hook is the safest to implement.

The first example I would like to point to is a debouncing hook I've created that looks something like this:\r\n  \r\n```javascript\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  const debounced = setTimeout(() => setDebounced(steps), 500);\r\n  return () => clearTimeout(debounced);\r\n}, [steps])\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then I have another one, that actually performs the request:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuseEffect(request, [debounced])\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it all works fine, apart from when the component is mounted and unmounted.\r\nIn the class model I was able to make sure it never runs the first time and on unmounting I could clear the timeout and, if the state value differs from prop (yes I know, you shouldn't mirror your props but I have to debounce somewhere), I could just perform a last request before I unmount. \r\nFurthermore, `componentDidUpdate` really made it easy preventing this from running the first time. I'm not quite sure how to approach this with hooks.\r\nPerhaps I'm doing it all wrong but to Patrick's point, the class way was more straight forward.\r\n\r\nAnother example: I code in RN and use the Animated API a lot. I have cases that translates into something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  if (inAddStage) moveAndShowStep(); // Animate with Animated API\r\n}, [inAddStage]);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis works well but it does perform an unnecessary initial run which makes me wonder if I've missed the point with hooks (again, to Patrick's point, it seems a bit more complex sometimes). Why isn't there a hook that **doesn't** run the first time btw? Again, with the old lifecycles it was much clearer how to prevent this from happening (using `componentDidUpdate`).\r\n\r\nOn a last note, I just want to say that I'm very fond of the idea and wholeheartedly support the functional approach and I really like the concept of hooks being \"state observers\", that react only when the specified attributes change - which basically makes the whole code more declarative.\r\nI've just started using them so I'll probably figure things out along the way but I thought I could give you something since you didn't get any answer :)"

          "body": "#13841 deprecated presumably [\"all usage\"](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13841#issuecomment-429444800) of `findDOMNode`. This is not the case if passed a host component<sup>1</sup>. I wanted to verify if this is intended or not since we have a use case for not issuing a deprecation warning for host components:\r\n\r\nWe have a component library that lets the user pass a custom component that is rendered. It can be a different DOM node or an actual component:\r\n```js\r\nclass LibraryComponent() {\r\n  // this is incomplete. It's just one instance where we get it\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    this.button = ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this);\r\n    listenForFocusKeys(ownerWindow(this.button));\r\n\r\n    if (this.props.action) {\r\n      this.props.action({\r\n        focusVisible: () => {\r\n          this.setState({ focusVisible: true });\r\n          this.button.focus();\r\n        },\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { as: Component } = this.props;\r\n\treturn <Component />\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever we required the DOM node of the rendered component for focus handling (essentially adding a focus-visible polyfill). Before deprecation we used `findDOMNode(this)`. Now that `findDOMNode` is deprecated we want to move away from that usage while enabling some backwards compatibility:\r\n```diff\r\nclass LibraryComponent() {\r\n+ buttonRef = React.createRef();\r\n  // this is incomplete. It's just one instance where we get it\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n-   this.button = ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this);\r\n-   listenForFocusKeys(ownerWindow(this.button));\r\n+   listenForFocusKeys(ownerWindow(this.getButtonNode()));\r\n\r\n    if (this.props.action) {\r\n      this.props.action({\r\n        focusVisible: () => {\r\n          this.setState({ focusVisible: true });\r\n-         this.button.focus();\r\n+         this.getButtonNode().focus();\r\n        },\r\n      });\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n  \r\n+ getButtonNode() {\r\n+   return ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this.buttonRef.current);\r\n+ }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    const { as: Component } = this.props;\r\n-\treturn <Component />\r\n+\treturn <Component ref={this.buttonRef} />\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change:\r\n1. is breaking usage with function components `<LibraryComponent as={SomeFunctionComponent} />`\r\n2. strict mode compatible with `<LibraryComponent as=\"div\" />` or any other host component or ref forwarding component\r\n3. not strict mode ready but also not breaking for `<LibraryComponent as={SomeClassComponent} />`\r\n\r\nThe test added with this PR is basically ensuring the third behavior.\r\n\r\nFollowup on https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13841#issuecomment-433416333\r\n\r\n<sup>1</sup> Not sure if this is the correct term."

I have no idea how to reenter eagerReducer calculation after first scheduled work (& after render gets fully processed & committed). This might very well be just me not understanding how fibers work - but currently I'm confused by this. It doesn't enter this code branch because `fiber.expirationTime` is not 0 (NoWork) and the work gets scheduled right away. Any pointers regarding this? Is this valid? Might this be a bug somewhere?\r\n2. The logic around reducer bailouts is somewhat iffy for me - maybe it's just a matter of mentioning those in the documentation:\r\n- not every reducer update can bailout from rendering. If the action queue gets processed in the render phase then it's just not possible, we are already rendering after all. \r\n- action queue gets processed in the render phase for reducers declared inside render, this means that any new state computation might depend on the \"fresh\" props. This is not the case for the bailout mechanism though - it's only possible to perform a bailout when dispatching an action (so when we do not have access to the fresh props). Should this restriction be mentioned in the docs? IMHO this behaviour is inconsistent - for the greater good, so it's acceptable but I think it should be documented because it's slightly inconsistent & people might trip over this.\r\n\r\n**Note** I'm happy to provide documentation changes if needed, I'd like to discuss those points first to get a better understanding of things."

Because batching is a renderer/reconciliation-level concern, this API is exported by the renderer packages, not the core `react` package.\r\n\r\nThe React team has recently encouraged the Redux team to make use of `unstable_batchedUpdates` in React-Redux.  However, this becomes complicated due to how that API is being exported.\r\n\r\nIt's possible to deal with this at the bundler level.  Some experimentation shows that creating an alternate file with a `.native.js` extension will cause that to be picked up by the RN bundler, as in this example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// batch.js\r\nimport {unstable_batchedUpdates} from \"./react-dom\";\r\n\r\n// ./react-dom.js\r\nexport {unstable_batchedUpdates} from \"react-dom\"\r\n\r\n// ./react-dom.native.js\r\nexport {unstable_batchedUpdates} from \"react-native\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not handle the case where an alternative React renderer is being used.  The [list of other React renderers is continuing to grow](https://github.com/chentsulin/awesome-react-renderer), which means that a React library that needs batching would have to deal with that situation in some way.  This becomes extremely complicated when you start considering variations on bundlers, module formats, and build environments.\r\n\r\nIt would be extremely beneficial if the React core itself exported a `batchedUpdates` API.  That could default to being a noop wrapper like `(callback) => callback()` if no suitable implementation was available.\r\n\r\nI know that `unstable_batchedUpdates()` is, uh... \"unstable\".  However, the React team has stated that \"it's the most stable of the unstable APIs\", and \"half of Facebook depends on this\".\r\n\r\nI think it would really help the ecosystem if some form of this API was solidified and exported from the core React package itself."

However, using `.render()` to rehydrate is still officially supported.\r\n\r\nI can implement a fix and make a PR.

This seems like a bug, because, as documented [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#bailing-out-of-a-state-update), `If you update a State Hook to the same value as the current state, React will bail out without rendering the children or firing effects.`\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nSince the state does not change, bail out on the re-render.\r\nThis can be worked around by adding a check before `setState` to check if the state has changed before calling the function.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

Allowing a prefix would solve this particular use case. Maybe as opinionated as `/^${prefix}_use[A-Z0-9].*$/`.\r\n\r\n`useUnstableMediaQuery` is not a good solution IMO since it implies that the media query is unstable. Same for `Unstable_useMediaQuery`. This is pretty hacky since the linter considers this a component. React has already set precedent with prefixing experimental features with `unstable_` so this naming pattern is not that exotic.\r\n\r\nHappy to work on a PR.\r\n"

Perhaps context is changing. But my biggest frustrations lately have been due to renders happening when they shouldn't, or seem like they shouldn't.\r\n\r\nFor example I can have a component like so:\r\n\r\n```ts\r\nconst Component = React.memo(() => <div />, (a, b) => true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I'll find it calling render quite often in a performance sensitive area.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to have docs somewhere that really go into why a component render is being called.\r\n\r\nFurther, it would be even more helpful to have a sort of \"debug stream\" you could hook into to see React logging reasons why things are updated in a clean fashion. That this doesn't exist already is a bit of a mystery. It would have saved a ridiculous amount of time for myself over the last years, and I'm sure many others. It would look something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(render) ComponentName [props changed]\r\n(render) OtherComponentName [props changed] [state changed]\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven better would be to show some sort of tree structure. And show the results of memo/shouldComponentUpdate, and why they may have been ignored:\r\n\r\n```\r\n(render) ComponentName [memo: true | ignored due to context change in: SomeContext] \r\n```\r\n"

I've tried to understand what exactly is happening (wanted to send a PR with a fix already in it 😉 ), but failed to do so - need to dig deeper.\r\n\r\nMy current conclusion is that this fails because of the \"simple memo\" optimization - `workLoop` doesnt see this memo element at all, it \"jumps\" from working on Outer directly to Inner which has fresh `pendingProps` which are used as argument for working on Inner as it correctly has to rerender itself because it reads changed context. So it doesnt bail out on finished work (correctly) and commits used new props as memoized ones later.\r\n\r\n**Why this matters?**\r\nBecause it's inconsistent with \"regular\" memo component. Conceptually from the user's perspective `React.memo(Component)` & `React.memo(Component, shallowEqual)` should behave exactly the same (but they dont)\r\n\r\nI've prepared a demo to showcase the problem - https://codesandbox.io/s/jp21pwzrv9"

Given the code snippet above, the plug-in should generate the following output:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nlet _anonymousFnComponent, _anonymousFnComponent2\r\n\r\nexport default ({ data, sortComparator, filterPredicate, history }) => {\r\n  const transformedData = React.useMemo(() =>\r\n    data.filter(filterPredicate).sort(sortComparator)\r\n  , [data, data.filter, filterPredicate, sortComparator])\r\n\r\n  return React.createElement(_anonymousFnComponent2 = _anonymousFnComponent2 || (() => {\r\n    const _onClick2 = React.useCallback(() => history.pop(), [history, history.pop])\r\n\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <button className=\"back-btn\" onClick={_onClick2} />\r\n        <ul className=\"data-list\">\r\n          {transformedData.map(({ id, value }) =>\r\n            React.createElement(_anonymousFnComponent = _anonymousFnComponent || (() => {\r\n              const _onClick = React.useCallback(() =>\r\n                history.push(`data/${id}`)\r\n              , [history, history.push, id])\r\n\r\n              return (\r\n                <li className=\"data-item\" key={id} onClick={_onClick}>\r\n                  {value}\r\n                </li>\r\n              )\r\n            }), { key: id })\r\n          )}\r\n        </ul>\r\n      </div>\r\n    )\r\n  }), null)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe plug-in will:\r\n\r\n- `useCallback()` automatically when a function is created.\r\n- `useMemo()` automatically when a value is assigned.\r\n- Will memoize inline callbacks.\r\n\r\nI don't see however how can `useEffect()` be inferred automatically and if it's a good idea. The plug-in is not a feature request directly for React, but since it's stated in the docs I thought maybe it can be useful somehow. Maybe it can potentially be included as part of `create-react-app`? Would like to hear your thoughts about it. An alternative solution is suggested at #14406, but I don't see why do this at runtime when everything can be done ahead of time and save processing power.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.8-alpha (hooks)\r\n"

But there‘re many other scenarios can't use `updater` to resolve. Here are some more code snippets:\r\n#### 1. Access states in a timer.\r\n```javascript\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  // or setInterval\r\n  const id = setTimeout(() => {\r\n    // access states\r\n  }, period);\r\n  return () => clearTimeout(id);\r\n}, inputs);\r\n```\r\n#### 2. Access states in WebSocket callbacks\r\n```javascript\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  // create a WebSocket client named \"ws\"\r\n  ws.onopen = () => {\r\n    // access states\r\n  };\r\n  ws.onmessage = () => {\r\n    // access states\r\n  };\r\n  return () => ws.close();\r\n}, inputs);\r\n```\r\n#### 3. Access states in Promise\r\n```javascript\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  create_a_promise().then(() => {\r\n    // access states\r\n  });\r\n}, inputs);\r\n```\r\n#### 4. Access states in event callbacks\r\n```javascript\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  function handleThatEvent() {\r\n    // access states\r\n  }\r\n  instance.addEventListener('eventName', handleThatEvent);\r\n  return instance.removeEventListener('eventName', handleThatEvent);\r\n}, inputs);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe had to use some workaround patterns to resolve those cases, like\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14543#issuecomment-452676760\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14543#issuecomment-453058025\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14543#issuecomment-453079958\r\nOr a funny way:\r\n```javascript\r\nconst [state, setState] = useState();\r\nuseEffect(() => {\r\n  // or setInterval\r\n  const id = setTimeout(() => {\r\n    // access states\r\n    setState((prevState) => {\r\n      // Now I can do anything with state...🤮\r\n      ...\r\n      return prevState;\r\n    });\r\n  }, period);\r\n  return () => clearTimeout(id);\r\n}, inputs);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo let's discuss and wait...\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14543#issuecomment-452713416\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.

          "body": "This is more about a bridge between actual DOM Tree and React Tree.\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nfeature\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nYou can _portal_ a part of your rendering tree to another place in Dom Tree, and React would handle events, including events on Capture Phase like there were no portals - events could dive through all the _react_ parents, and bubble up through all the _react_ parents.\r\n\r\nThis is quite useful, as long as portal is an implementation detail, but useful only for normal events; there are more cases around it.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIt's better to explain it by example\r\n- you have a Modal Dialog and it uses a Focus Lock, ie focus could not leave it.\r\n- inside Modal you have a Custom Select, with Dropdown menu rendered via a portal.\r\n- you could not use it, as long as from DOM prospective `ModalNode.contains(DropDownNode)` is always false, and Focus Lock will prevent focusing.\r\n\r\nIt's a real issue - https://github.com/reach/reach-ui/issues/83, https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock/issues/19.\r\n\r\nProposed solution:\r\n- `containsNode(domNode):boolean` - _React-aware_ version of DOM API `node.contains(anotherNode)`.\r\n- `getHostNodes():Nodes[]` - returns a list of all root nodes inside \"current component\" including direct children and portals. Similar to `ReactDom.findDomNode`, and (proposed)refs attached to React.Fragment. It just finds all nodes \"you are consists of\". As a result you will be able to `tab` from one `piece` of you to another, making focus management independed of implementation details.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n- requires Component to access fiber, DOM node to access fiber thought node, or an new `hook` to do it in a functional way.\r\n- does twice dreadfull things than deprecated `findDomNode`\r\n- usage scope is very narrow.\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n- _my_ use case requires _momentum_ access to a rendered tree, and does not suffer async stuff as `findDomNode`, where underlaying node might not be yet created. Stuff like \"_does something `containsNode` right now_\", or _\"`getHostNodes` I consist from right now\"_ are sync, and the question asked about actual DOM tree structure.\r\n\r\nExample using [react-dom-reflection](https://github.com/theKashey/react-dom-reflection), which implements required API - https://codesandbox.io/s/1or60v506l\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nNever worked"

Once the thrown promise is resolved, React removes the `display: none` style.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThe children components have no easy way to know when the `display: none` style is removed by React. This is problematic when one child component needs to read from the DOM layout to correctly display its elements. Most people wait for the `componentDidMount` callback to trigger, but because the element is `display: none`, it can't read any value from the DOM layout.\r\n\r\nThe issue was discovered in https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/issues/14077. I believe that React should provide a lifecycle so the children components know when they are visible, that it's safe to do layout computations. \r\n\r\nThe best workaround I'm aware of it to use the [Intersection Observer API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) but it requires a polyfill on IE 11 and Safari.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

          "body": "I open this issue ([as suggested by @gaearon on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1070770594323554310)) to discuss how Hook’s inputs argument should be inferred.\r\n\r\n## Background\r\n\r\nThe current [Hooks API reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) cites (emphasis mine):\r\n\r\n> The array of inputs is not passed as arguments to the function. Conceptually, though, that’s what they represent: every value referenced inside the function should also appear in the inputs array. **In the future, a sufficiently advanced compiler could create this array automatically.**\r\n\r\nCaptivated by this sentence (and the idea of bringing “the future” closer) I built [`hooks.macro`][hm], a Babel Macro which tries to do exactly this. That is, to infer the second argument to `useMemo`, `useCallback` and `use*Effect` hooks.\r\n\r\nThe tool trasform this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nimport { useAutoMemo } from 'hooks.macro';\r\nfunction MyComponent({ propValue }) {\r\n  return useAutoMemo(() => propValue.split('').join('-'));\r\n  //     ---^^^^----                                    ^ no inputs\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo this:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nfunction MyComponent({ propValue }) {\r\n  return React.useMemo(() => propValue.split('').join('-'), [propValue]);\r\n  //     ^---^ ^-----^                                       ^-------^\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the process of designing the constraints of that tool, I realized there are more than a few open questions, whose answers can be found only with guidance from the core React team and a broader discussion with the community.\r\n\r\n## Rationale\r\n\r\nWhy should we bother with this topic? The reasons that motivated me in implementing `hooks.macro` were the following.\r\n\r\n1. Failing to populate the inputs array correctly has sad consequences:\r\n\r\n   1. too wide, and it will invalidate the use of memoization itself, and/or bring potential perf issues;\r\n\r\n   2. too narrow, and bugs can be tricky to identify (IMHO unit tests are not viable to avoid this: you need to test _changes_, not just different possible _values_;)\r\n\r\n   3. bugs caused by having non local values are potentially non deterministic.\r\n\r\n2. Keeping the inputs array updated is important, but it’s a matter of discipline:\r\n\r\n   1. when I change the “body” of the hook I need to check it;\r\n\r\n   2. when I change the semantics of a used valued I need to verify if I need to include it (e.g. when it was a constant and now a prop);\r\n\r\n   3. not introducing bugs during merge conflicts is matter of even _higher_ discipline (since usually inputs will fit in a single line, you probably need to edit the line to solve the conflict).\r\n\r\n3. By removing the burden of adding the inputs array, we reduce the mental overhead of using the memoizing hooks (namely `useMemo` and `useCallback`). This let us:\r\n\r\n   1. make following the best practices easier,\r\n\r\n   2. encourage the use of memoization in unexpected places (such as directly inside the final returning JSX of a component).\r\n\r\n4. Nothing is stopping me from shooting my own feet with obvious errors (such as passing the result of a non-memoized array literal ad an input). If a stable enough approach is found, this could be even solved automatically by memoizing all necessary inputs too.\r\n\r\n5. It’s an error-prone and boring practice that can be automated away.\r\n\r\n## Current implementation\r\n\r\n(Straight from [`hooks.macro`’s README][hm])\r\n\r\n#### Features\r\n\r\n1. Extracts all references used, and adds them to the _inputs_ array.\r\n\r\n2. Favors **strict correctness over performance**, but uses **safe optimizations:**\r\n\r\n   1. skips constants and useless inputs;\r\n\r\n   2. traverses all functions called or referenced, and appends _their_ dependencies too, removing the need for unnecessary `useCallback` hooks.\r\n\r\n#### Constraints\r\n\r\n1. Only variables created in the scope of the component body are automatically trapped as inputs.\r\n\r\n2. Only variables, and not properties’ access, are trapped. This means that if you use `obj.prop` only `[obj]` will become part of the memoization invalidation keys. This is a problem for refs, and will be addressed specifically in a future release.\r\n\r\n   You can work around this limitation by creating a variable which holds the current value, such as `const { current } = ref`.\r\n\r\n3. Currently there’s no way to add additional keys for more fine grained cache invalidation. Could be an important escape hatch when you do nasty things, but in that case I’d prefer to use `useMemo`/`useCallback` directly.\r\n\r\n4. Only locally defined functions declarations and explicit function expressions (`let x = () => {}`) are traversed for indirect dependencies — all other function calls (such as `xxx()`) are treated as normal input dependencies and appended too. This is unnecessary (but not harmful) for setters coming from `useState`, and not an issue at all if the function is the result of `useCallback` or `useAutoCallback`.\r\n\r\n## Questions\r\n\r\nAs I said before I have few open questions for the core React team, but I’m sure the whole community will be impactful in the discussion.\r\n\r\n1. What were/are the requirements of the «sufficiently advanced compiler» you envision? Is the current approach of `hooks.macro` aligned with those?\r\n\r\n2. Using a broader approach, Flow/TypeScript hints could give an incredible amount of precision not available on the pure Babel pipeline. I feel pre-pack can help here too (we could help pre-pack do its thing actually) but I’m not sure how.\r\n\r\n3. Are users potentially scared by the amount of black magic involved? I _tried_ to follow the Hooks lead by having very clear, very understandable rules. Is this _enough_?\r\n\r\n4. The auto-closure feature of `useMemo` (you don’t need an arrow function) has received the most negative feedback in the small discussions I had online. Yet I personally find the most interesting hook of this library, since adds so little overhead I can throw it any time I need… potentially abusing it eventually (so, points against it?)\r\n\r\n5. I personally prefer to have a different API that makes it clear that those are not standard hooks without \"inputs\". A Babel plugin that transform all hooks without an explicit inputs array seems silly and scary — you get used to _not_ passing them and you don't have the API signaling you that you need to.\r\n\r\n6. Since this is a specialized form of lambda-lifting, are you willing to add some advanced hooks (with one of your lovely silly prefixes such as `DONT_USE_`) that pass the inputs as arguments to creator/effect function? This open some interesting perf optimization opportunities by hoisting functions higher up.\r\n\r\n[hm]: https://github.com/yuchi/hooks.macro\r\n"

I only started with some examples from `mui-org/material-ui`.\r\n### with a planned alternative\r\n- focus handling (React Fire, \"exploratory phase\") \r\n- passive event listeners ([facebook/react#6436]). \"Passive events will likely be a part of [React Fire].\" - [facebook/react#13525]\r\n\r\n## State of `forwardRef`\r\n`react` has 3.4M downloads/week.\r\n\r\n### `hoist-non-react-statics` (3.9M downloads/week; not clear what percentage is 2.x)\r\nA utility mainly used in HOCs and [encouraged to use in the official react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html#static-methods-must-be-copied-over). However everyone stuck at `2.x` will likely encounter issues with `forwardRef` since that version\r\ndoes not handle any `react@^16.3` features. ^3.2.0 should have no issues apart from some minor\r\nissues with propTypes hoisting from `forwardRef` to `forwardRef`. The latest stable from zeit/next still uses that outdated version. However the latest canary for 7.0.3 does not.\r\n\r\n### react-docgen (400k downloads/week)\r\nNot recognized as a valid component definition. PR open at [reactjs/react-docgen#311].\r\n\r\n### react-redux (1.4M downloads/week)\r\n`connect` does properly forward their refs in the beta release of 6.x. No timeline for stable release given\r\nhowever 3 betas have already been released so it's probably soon.\r\n\r\n### react-router (1.4M downloads/week)\r\n`withRouter` is planned to forward refs ([ReactTraining/react-router#6056#issuecomment-435524678]).\r\nHowever no comment about the other components and no major release candidate is published.\r\n\r\n### display name\r\n`React.forwardRef` components are recognized by `react-devtools`. However when wrapped\r\nin a HOC it's very likely that the display name is lost. See [facebook/react#14319]\r\n\r\n### The issue\r\n**Assumptions:**\r\n- you are not in control of your whole component tree i.e. you use components from 3rd party libraries\r\n- you want to use `React.ConcurrentMode`\r\n- Usable includes production and development. It specifically means for development that deprecation warnings in a component\r\n  make that component not usable in development mode because of all the *noise* it adds in those cases.\r\n  *Noise* because it's not actionable if that component is from a 3rd party library.\r\n\r\nIf none of those applies to you then you probably don't have an issue with `findDOMNode` deprecation.\r\n\r\nThe mode of a partial tree can only be made more restrictive but not loosened up. If\r\nyou wrap your tree in `React.StrictMode` and use a component from a 3rd party library\r\nthat 3rd party library has to be `React.StrictMode` compliant too. \r\n\r\nThis means that you can't use `React.StrictMode` effectiveley. This might be ok since it's for development only anyway and has no implications for production. However Concurrent mode can have actual implications for production.  Since it is new and the community wants to use new things libraries have to make sure that they are strict mode compliant too.\r\n\r\nIn addition between the relase of an alternative in the form of `React.forwardRef` and the deprecation only 7 months have passed. One could argue that this is plenty of time but (at least from my perspective) the work on migrating from `findDOMNode` to refs and `forwardRef` was postponed because `findDOMNode` was not deprecated yet.  However the actual deprecation happened one day before the release of `unstable_ConcurrentMode` virtually giving no time to migrate. ~We'll have to see when a stable `16.7` release will happen but assuming this happens today only a month has passed between deprecation and *virtual* removal.~ [React 16.x Roadmap] was release pointing towards Q2 2019 as a release date of stable `React.Concurrent` mode. This relaxes pressure for library maintainers quite a bit IMO.\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nRefs are not a viable upgrade path to replace `findDOMNode` yet. \r\nUntil refs are usable without headaches from forwarding refs `findDOMNode` should be undeprecated.\r\n\r\n## Releated\r\n- [forwarding Refs guide on official react docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html)\r\n- [findDOMNode API documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#finddomnode) (includes arguments against usage)\r\n- [pull request that deprecated findDOMNode](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13841)\r\n\r\n[facebook/react#6436]: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/6436\r\n[facebook/react#13525]: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525\r\n[facebook/react#14319]: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14319\r\n[reactjs/react-docgen#311]: https://github.com/reactjs/react-docgen/pull/311\r\n[ReactTraining/react-router#6056#issuecomment-435524678]: https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues/6056#issuecomment-435524678\r\n[React 16.x Roadmap]: https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/11/27/react-16-roadmap.html"

Additionally, the bookmark in the link specified in the `@see` comment is no longer valid so I can't confirm the official list of keys.  Looking at [the latest version of the spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#determine-keydown-keyup-keyCode), the key in question appears in the `Optionally fixed virtual keys` section rather than the `Fixed virtual keys` section, but then, none of the 1xx keys appear at all in the fixed list.\r\n\r\nThe `translateToKey` hash in the `react-dom` package's `getEventKey` function appears to be missing the `-` (dash) key.  When used with CTRL+SHIFT, this key (and probably others) is reported as `Unidentified` in IE11 and since it's not in the `translateToKey` map, returns back to the code as `Unidentified` which breaks keyboard shortcut handling.\r\n\r\nThis can be seen by navigating to https://w3c.github.io/uievents/tools/key-event-viewer.html and in IE11, pressing `CTRL + SHIFT + -` (note that you will need to check `keydown` under `preventDefault` in the options table or the browser will zoom out.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIf it's a bug, it shouldn't allow resolution to just fall through back to the browser.  If it's not, then the code is correct - but then requires special handling.\r\n\r\nIf I add `'189': '-'` to the hash, it works...on a US Keyboard.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nTested on React 16.6.1 in IE11 on Windows."

If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n5. Run `yarn test-prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn debug-test --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n9.

          "body": "TL;DR: Can you expose [shared/getComponentName](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/shared/getComponentName.js)?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Note: if the issue is about documentation or the website, please file it at:\r\n  https://github.com/reactjs/reactjs.org/issues/new\r\n-->\r\n\r\n**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**\r\nExpose an API to get the display name of every component (in `__DEV__` only).\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\nMost of the ecosystem still uses `Component.displayName || Component.name || someFallbackName` \r\n (with some branching depending on the type of `Component`) when setting the display name of an enhanced component i.e. `connect()(WrappedComponent)` will result in `\"connect(WrappedComponent)\"` as a `displayName`.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\nSince components created by `forwardRef` or `memo` are not actual functions these higher-order components are not able to determine a proper display name while `react-devtools` is able to:\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/zqj9v50243\r\n\r\n- `react-redux` creates `\"connect(Component)\"`\r\n- `react-router` creates `\"withRouter(undefined)\"`\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nThe new \"exotic-components\" should work with the existing 3rd party libraries WRT to `displayName`.\r\n\r\nNow there are a couple of solutions to this issue:\r\n1. **Edit:** Expose [shared/getComponentName](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/shared/getComponentName.js)\r\n2. This is the responsibility of the ecosystem. It should provide a solution and maintain it. Somewhat blocked by #12882, related: #12932\r\n3. Grant access to the functionality used in `react-devtools` (or would this only work on the fibers?)\r\n4. Set a `name` (or `displayName` no preference here) property on those \"exotic-components\" (don't know how to call them). Naive implementation e.g.: `name: 'ForwardRef(' + fn.name + ')'`.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nI guess this started with `forwardRef` in 16.3.\r\n"

But if it depends on props or state, it's likely it'll invalidate too often. See https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14092#issuecomment-435907249 for current workarounds.\r\n\r\n`useReducer` doesn't suffer from this because the reducer is evaluated directly in the render phase. @sebmarkbage had an idea about giving `useCallback` similar semantics but it'll likely require complex implementation work. Seems like we'd have to do _something_ like this though.\r\n\r\nI'm filing this just to acknowledge the issue exists, and to track further work on this."

So something changed internally, but it's hard to pinpoint what. Unfortunately I haven't been able to create a small repro for that specific case that works in 16.4.2 but not 16.5.0 – so I'm making this issue about avoiding the cause in the first place.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nNaively, my thinking is that because errors are more exceptional, let the state from error handlers take precedence. Probably there's a reason why this can't happen so a warning of some kind when this can happen would be nice. Two ways to do this comes to mind:\r\n\r\n1. Cross-check that keys in state from `getDerivedStateFromProps` or `setState` in `componentDidCatch` don't collide with `getDerivedStateFromError` (sounds a bit far fetched?)\r\n2. Be more explicit in documentation for error boundaries about how `getDerivedStateFromProps` will run last so that a developer can consider this case\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.5.0 and up (16.4.2 behaves a bit differently – see above), all platforms/browsers."

Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n"

The real situation I was trying to reproduce is when we expire another update *while* rendering a just-expired update, and that kicks off another rendering cycle without yielding.

            "body": "Given that we’re considering a [rewrite of the event system](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/13613#issuecomment-420286431) and are thinking about [attaching events to the React root](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525), I thought it would be fitting to explore all our options on where to mount the event listeners a little and combine all the knowledge that is scattered across the repo.\r\n\r\nIn general, there are three candidates for attaching event listeners:\r\n\r\n1. Document  Listeners\r\n2. React Root Listeners\r\n3. Element Listeners\r\n\r\nEvery option comes with shortcomings and I want to summarize what we’ve learned over the years.\r\n\r\n## Document Listeners\r\n\r\nHistorically, React always listened at the document level and implemented a synthetic event system to simulate capture and bubble phases inside the React tree. Most event listeners are listening at the bubble phase which means that users can still add capture-level document listeners and see them fire before React will process the event.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, not all events bubble in the DOM. To support bubbling for all events, React sometimes eagerly adds event listeners (media events, for example) or listens to the capture phase instead.\r\n\r\nWhile it usually works to leave the React event system and attach native listeners when needed, there are certain caveats that come with that. One example is that calling `.stopPropagation()` on a capture document-level listener has no effect (#12518, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/285#issuecomment-253502585/). Another implication of this is that interoperability between other React roots or third-party frameworks will behave unexpectedly (#8117, #8693).\r\n\r\nSome browsers have certain optimizations in place that make handling of document listeners complicated (Safari is not properly bubbling when document listeners are used #12717, #12989 and Chrome doesn’t respect preventDefault() on touch start at the document level https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11530#issuecomment-413704069).\r\n\r\nWe’re also never cleaning up document-level listeners (#7128).\r\n\r\nThere are certain benefits of this solution as well. Our current event system can use the same \"event bus\" to implement polyfills that require document based listeners. Implementation of portal-bubbling is easier because we only need to ensure that we’re already listening at the document of the portal target (more on that later).\r\n\r\n## React Root Listeners (#2043)\r\n\r\nOne solution to the issues outlined above is the use of React roots as the mount target for events. This would still rely on event delegation and would require a synthetic event system.\r\n\r\nRoot level listeners would certainly help make bubbling more robust when using multiple React instances since we no longer add all listeners at the same level. This will, however, only work for bubbling. Some events use capturing (`scroll`, `focus`, `blur`, `cancel`, and `close`) and would fire in an inverse bubble order (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8117#issuecomment-257024618, https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12919#issuecomment-392556395). Capture handlers between multiple roots will also always fire in the wrong order.\r\n\r\nPortal bubbling will also become more complicated since we have to find out if the portal root is inside the react-root to see if we need to attach listeners to the portal root as well. Consider the following example, where we need to add listeners to the `#react-root` as well as the `#portal-root`:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<body>\r\n  <div id=\"react-root\"></div>\r\n  <div id=\"portal-root\"></div>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd compare it with this example, where we don’t need that:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<body>\r\n  <div id=\"react-root\">\r\n    <div id=\"portal-root\"></div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</body>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI’ve compiled a list of previous implementation attempts and the issues that were pointed out as well:\r\n\r\n| Date          | PR                                          | Issues                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |\r\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| Oct&nbsp;2016 | https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8117 | <ul><li>Enter/Leave Shims (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8117#issuecomment-256498143)</li><li>Issues when using the same instance of React (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8117#issuecomment-256503428)</li><li>Captured events (like focus in Firefox) will fire in reverse order (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8117#issuecomment-257024618)</li><li>iOS Tap Highlight (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8117#issuecomment-257105712, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12989#issuecomment-414266839)</li><li>Select Shims (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8117#issuecomment-270206114)</li></ul> |\r\n| Jun&nbsp;2016 | https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7088 | <ul><li>Firefox v8.01 mousemove events (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7088#issuecomment-227191272)</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\r\n| Aug&nbsp;2014 | https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/2050 | <ul><li>Enter/Leave Shims (https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/2050#issue-19863619)</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\r\n\r\nIt’s probably possible to work around some/all of the issues. The invalid capturing order can be worked around by adding both a bubble and a capture listener for regular events and then only trigger the appropriate phase. The shims can probably be rewritten and if they need the document, additional listeners could be added. iOS tap highlight could be disabled via CSS. To get rid of some of the edge cases around events that don’t bubble in the browser, we should consider deprecating support for this all together.\r\n\r\n### New Features\r\n\r\nSince we’re taking the time to rethink the event system, I also want us to think about: **Passive Event Listeners (#6436)** and **Web Components (#7901, #9242)**.\r\n\r\nI think we _can_ (albeit with an additional implementation effort) support passive event systems while keep using event delegation: We’d add two different listeners (one for capturing and one for bubbling) and handle them as completely different events. \r\n\r\nSupport for shadow roots is a bit more complex as event delegation doesn’t really make sense there. We can’t easily consider the shadow root the same as a React root or a portal root since we can’t rely on adding listeners to the `#react-root` if it’s the parent of a shadow root. Consider the following case:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div id=\"react-root\">\r\n  <!-- Listening on #react-root will catch events inside the #portal-root -->\r\n  <div id=\"portal-root\"></div> \r\n  <!-- Listening on #react-root will NOT catch events inside the #shadow-root -->\r\n  <my-component id=\"shadow-root\"></my-component>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere’s a handy comparison of Custom Elements support of different JavaScript framework and [React can definitely do better](https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/#react). With the planned changes to the event system, we should work on that.\r\n\r\n## Element Listeners (sort of #4751)\r\n\r\nThere’s a more radical approach to changing the event system and that is to get rid of event delegation altogether. This is what happens in [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact/wiki/Differences-to-React#whats-missing), [react-dom-lite](https://github.com/jquense/react-dom-lite/blob/master/src/events/index.js#L35-L36), [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/52719ccab8fccffbdf497b96d3731dc86f04c1ce/test/unit/modules/vdom/modules/events.spec.js#L5-L14), and probably other frameworks as well (We should research Ember and Angular at this point).\r\n\r\nIn this case, it’s trivial to add support for passive event listeners and bubble/capture will behave as expected. It also allows us to completely remove the need of the synthetic event system as we could rely on the browser for this. We also know that some browsers can better optimize certain events if they are attached directly to the element (#1254, #1964).\r\n\r\nI can think of at least two major roadblocks for this, though:\r\n\r\n1. **Performance** \r\n   Event delegation avoids the need to `addEventListener()` for every element with an event handler. We should figure out how significant this overhead really is - especially while considering the possible bundle size improvement that should make initial-render faster again. This needs to be compared at a real-world application. \r\n\r\n   While doing some [very rough benchmarking](https://github.com/philipp-spiess/react-event-benchmark/tree/755b0e208e6ae920f5b44573f09ffb519eed47ba) (It’s a microbenchmark so the outcomes are not representative for real apps) of an event-system less React, I noticed that there’s another feature of event delegation that is often overlooked: setState batching. Right now, React knows when all event listeners are called and can batch setState calls until this is the case. I looked a bit into a [potential callback mechanism](https://github.com/philipp-spiess/request-post-events-callback) that would fire when all events are processed and before the next frame is drawn but I don’t think this is possible in all browsers. We have to evaluate the performance implications on a real-world application to see how bad this is and how often setState batching is occurring (we could still batch inside the same event listener).\r\n\r\n2. **Portal Bubbling**\r\n   The big issue I see with portal bubbling is that we still need to use event delegation on the portal roots to catch events that are only listened to in parents. In the write-up about React Fire (#13525), @gaearon mentioned that we could use re-dispatching of native events but that would still require us to set up the listeners first.\r\n\r\n## Further Considerations\r\n\r\n- The whole synthetic event system currently accounts for **~20%** of the React DOM bundle size. [Back in July](https://github.com/philipp-spiess/react/commit/b4fda332b2be55e1b12021bd60209c6b442c3cda) I worked on an example that removed everything event related and added a tiny Preact-like system to find out how much we can save. I didn’t look into edge cases too much but I already got most of the tests to pass.\r\n- In general we might also consider adding an API for installing global DOM event handlers (#285) since the upcoming concurrent mode will make it more complicated to listen to arbitrary non React-controlled events (because of them possibly being fired during render time slices). This discussion is out of scope for this write-up though but maybe good to keep in mind.\r\n\r\nThat’s all I have for now. I’m especially curious for ways how we could implement portal bubbling when using element listeners - I’d say this is the biggest uncertainty I have right now. 🙂 \r\n"

However, the stated purpose of the feature referenced below is being violated in certain environments.\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?** \r\n\r\nReact 16+ surfaces an uncaught error during render, even when using `componentDidCatch` as designed or using try/catch around the render. As described in the comment [above the related code](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/shared/invokeGuardedCallbackImpl.js#L32:L49), this is a convenience provided for developers using DevTools for debugging purposes. However, the convenience provided for development debugging is changing behavior in specs, causing failures for otherwise protected code paths, which goes against this statement from the comment description for the code:\r\n\r\n> But because the error happens in a different event loop context, it does not interrupt the normal program flow.\r\n\r\nWhen the error occurs, a spec runner such as Mocha will fail the test with the uncaught error, then continue with the next test. After advancing, the second render of the component will complete and call the ReactDOM.render callback, which continues code from the already-failed test while a subsequent test is in progress. This pollutes the spec suite and leads to other issues that are not produced when using the Production version of React.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nAll relevant code and content has been included in [this CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/vvmv7q7o7y). Due to the use of karma/mocha, tests must be run locally. Inline comments add detail to behavior and expectations.\r\n\r\nTo see the tests pass, switch \"test\" to \"production\" in the `karma.js` file.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nTypically, DevTools are used in a different context from running specs—automation vs investigation, for lack of more precise terms. It should be an option rather than the default when using React in a non-production environment. At least in an environment of `test`, where spec runners are conditionally sensitive to global errors, developers must have the option to disable or disallow this behavior as it is implemented at this time.\r\n\r\nFor a second, perhaps more intuitive option, refer to this portion of the mentioned comment, talking about \"pause on caught exceptions\":\r\n\r\n> This is untintuitive, though, because even though React has caught the error, from the developer's perspective, the error is uncaught.\r\n\r\nWhen an exception during render is captured using `componentDidCatch` or try/catch as mentioned above, the exception should be considered \"caught,\" as the developer has explicitly created an error boundary around this render. In this case, expected behavior would be for the error to not be surfaced globally and for the developer to debug any exceptions within the error boundary they defined.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis is present only in the non-production version of React 16+. The `development` or `test` environments of React 16+ feature this behavior. React 15.* and below do not have this issue. Prior to React 16, explicit try/catch handlers were solely responsible for being an error boundary during render."

As some CSS properties accept unitless values, React maintains a blacklist of properties that shouldn't get `px` auto-appended.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that this solution doesn't scale. It requires us to add more & more properties to the list as CSS specs expand and recently the list grows faster; Flexbox & Grid added quite a few of them. What's more confusing, some of those props would work both with & without the `px` suffix and that changes the meaning (`lineHeight` is suffering from that).\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm a React newbie I'm quite familiar with this issue due to being a member of the jQuery Core team. jQuery has the same logic as React here and we keep having to add to the list. We've actually exposed the list at [jQuery.cssNumber](https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.cssNumber/) so that people don't always have to wait for us to add support for a property and do a release.\r\n\r\nThat's why we decided that in jQuery 4 we'll drop the auto-prefixing blacklist and turn to a whitelist that lists only a few most common properties to which we want to auto-append `px` (mostly because they're extremely common and we don't want to break the world too much); we plan to _not_ expand that list unless we missed something really common. You can see the current plan in my PR: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/4055. In particular, see the proposed whitelist in a (visualized) regexp in:\r\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/03e9dba3882868e1ee79f1fb0504326da925644f/src/css/isAutoPx.js.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI propose that React could do the same thing jQuery is planning to and switch the ever-expanding blacklist of CSS props that shouldn't have the `px` suffix applied to a small whitelist that should have the suffix applied.\r\n\r\nThis topic has been initially described in #13550.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nAll browses & OSs. I don't know how old this logic is in React."

            "body": "\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n**For latest status, see an update from June 5th, 2019: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525#issuecomment-499196939**\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThis year, the React team has mostly been focused on [fundamental improvements to React](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/01/sneak-peek-beyond-react-16.html).\r\n\r\nAs this work is getting closer to completion, we're starting to think of what the next major releases of React DOM should look like. There are quite a few [known problems](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Type%3A+Bug%22+label%3A%22Component%3A+DOM%22), and some of them are hard or impossible to fix without bigger internal changes.\r\n\r\nWe want to undo past mistakes that caused countless follow-up fixes and created much technical debt. We also want to remove some of the abstraction in the event system which has been virtually untouched since the first days of React, and is a source of much complexity and bundle size.\r\n\r\nWe're calling this effort \"React Fire\".\r\n\r\n### 🔥 React Fire \r\n\r\n**React Fire** is an effort to modernize React DOM. Our goal is to make React better aligned with how the DOM works, revisit some controversial past decisions that led to problems, and make React smaller and faster.\r\n\r\nWe want to ship this set of changes in a future React major release because some of them will unfortunately be breaking. Nevertheless, we think they're worth it. And we have more than 50 thousands components at Facebook to keep us honest about our migration strategy. We can't afford to rewrite product code except a few targeted fixes or automated codemods. \r\n\r\n### Strategy\r\n\r\nThere are a few different things that make up our current plan. We might add or remove something but here's the thinking so far:\r\n\r\n* **Stop reflecting input values in the `value` attribute (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11896).** This was originally added in React 15.2.0 via https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/6406. It was very commonly requested because people's conceptual model of the DOM is that the `value` they see in the DOM inspector should match the `value` JSX attribute. But that's not how the DOM works. When you type into a field, the browser doesn't update the `value` attribute. React shouldn't do it either. It turned out that this change, while probably helpful for some code relying on CSS selectors, caused a cascade of bugs — some of them still unfixed to this day. Some of the fallout from this change includes: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7179, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8395, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7328, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7233, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11881, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7253, https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9584, https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9806, https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9714, https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11534, https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/11746, https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12925. At this point it's clearly not worth it to keep fighting the browser, and we should revert it. The positive part of this journey is that thanks to tireless work from our DOM contributors (@nhunzaker, @aweary, @jquense, and @philipp-spiess) we now have detailed DOM test fixtures that will help us avoid regressions.\r\n\r\n* **Attach events at the React root rather than the document (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/2043).** Attaching event handlers to the document becomes an issue when embedding React apps into larger systems. The Atom editor was one of the first cases that bumped into this. Any big website also eventually develops very complex edge cases related to `stopPropagation` interacting with non-React code or across React roots (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/8693, https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/8117, https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12518). We will also want to attach events eagerly to every root so that we can do less runtime checks during updates.\r\n\r\n* **Migrate from `onChange` to `onInput` and don’t polyfill it for uncontrolled components (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9657).** See the linked issue for a detailed plan. It has been confusing that React uses a different event name for what's known as `input` event in the DOM. While we generally avoid making big changes like this without significant benefit, in this case we *also* want to change the behavior to remove some complexity that's only necessary for edge cases like mutating controlled inputs. So it makes sense to do these two changes together, and use that as an opportunity to make `onInput` and `onChange` work exactly how the DOM events do for uncontrolled components.\r\n\r\n* **Drastically simplify the event system (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4751).** The current event system has barely changed since its initial implementation in 2013. It is reused across React DOM and React Native, so it is unnecessarily abstract. Many of the polyfills it provides are unnecessary for modern browsers, and some of them create more issues than they solve. It also accounts for a significant portion of the React DOM bundle size. We don't have a very specific plan here, but we will probably fork the event system completely, and then see how minimal we can make it if we stick closer to what the DOM gives us. It's plausible that we'll get rid of synthetic events altogether. We should stop bubbling events like media events which don’t bubble in the DOM and don’t have a good reason to bubble. We want to retain some React-specific capabilities like bubbling through portals, but we will attempt to do this via simpler means (e.g. re-dispatching the event). Passive events will likely be a part of this. \r\n\r\n* **`className` → `class` (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/4331, see also https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13525#issuecomment-417818906 below).** This has been proposed countless times. We're already allowing passing `class` down to the DOM node in React 16. The confusion this is creating is not worth the syntax limitations it's trying to protect against. We wouldn't do this change by itself, but combined with everything else above it makes sense. Note we can’t just allow both without warnings because this makes it very difficult for a component ecosystem to handle. Each component would need to learn to handle both correctly, and there is a risk of them conflicting. Since many components process `className` (for example by appending to it), it’s too error-prone.\r\n\r\n### Tradeoffs\r\n\r\n* We can't make some of these changes if we aim to keep exposing the current private React event system APIs for projects like React Native Web. However, React Native Web will need a different strategy regardless because [React Fabric](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/blog/2018/06/14/state-of-react-native-2018) will likely move more of the responder system to the native side.\r\n\r\n* We may need to drop compatibility with some older browsers, and/or require more standalone polyfills for them. We still care about supporting IE11 but it's possible that we will not attempt to smooth over some of the existing browser differences — which is the stance taken by many modern UI libraries.\r\n\r\n### Rollout Plan\r\n\r\nAt this stage, the project is very exploratory. We don't know for sure if all of the above things will pan out. Because the changes are significant, we will need to dogfood them at Facebook, and try them out in a gradual fashion. This means we'll introduce a feature flag, fork some of the code, and keep it enabled at Facebook for a small group of people. The open source 16.x releases will keep the old behavior, but on master you will be able to run it with the feature flag on.\r\n\r\nI plan to work on the project myself for the most part, but I would very much appreciate more discussion and contributions from @nhunzaker, @aweary, @jquense, and @philipp-spiess who have been stellar collaborators and have largely steered React DOM while we were working on Fiber. If there's some area you're particularly interested in, please let me know and we'll work it out.\r\n\r\nThere are likely things that I missed in this plan. I'm very open to feedback, and I hope this writeup is helpful."

And there’s undoubtedly runtime overhead to it too. There are two separate issues here:\r\n\r\n* **warning** for invalid values\r\n* ensuring that the output for invalid values is **consistent** (e.g. functions are always skipped)\r\n\r\nThe conclusion we came to is that we should keep **warning** for bad values, but **as long as we warn, consistency is not necessary**. It's fine if we sometimes stringify a function, and sometimes skip it, as long as we always warn for those cases\r\n\r\n**Our guiding principle for invalid inputs should be that we handle them with the least amount of overhead** (both at runtime, and in terms of code size), not that they’re always handled the same way.\r\n\r\nOne exception to this is probably Symbols because they throw when stringified. So it seems like skipping them is actually desirable — unless we're okay with errors."

Native \"input\" input event is called for both numbers and the letter \"e\". With React the `onChange` event is only called for numbers. There's no way to catch \"e\" with `onChange`.\r\n\r\nThe \"e\" is even being filled when the input is controlled. The only way I can think of to work around this bug right now is to use `onKeyDown` and `preventDefault` when \"e\" or \"E\" is pressed.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React.

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\nReact: 16.4.2\r\nChrome: 68.0.3440.106\r\nWindows 10"

            "body": "Extracting from https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12643.\r\n\r\nThis issue has always been in React. I can reproduce it up to React 0.11. However **it's probably extremely rare in practice and isn't worth fixing**. I'm just filing this for posterity.\r\n\r\nHere is a minimal example.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nclass App extends React.Component {\r\n  state = {value: ''}\r\n  handleChange = (e) => {\r\n    this.setState({\r\n      value: e.target.value\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    document.addEventListener(\r\n      \"input\",\r\n      () => {\r\n        // COMMENT OUT THIS LINE TO FIX:\r\n        this.setState({});\r\n      },\r\n      true\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div>\r\n        <input\r\n          value={this.state.value}\r\n          onChange={this.handleChange}\r\n        />\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById(\"container\"));\r\n```\r\n\r\nTyping doesn't work — unless I comment out that `setState` call in the capture phase listener.\r\n\r\nSay the input is empty and we're typing `a`.\r\n\r\nWhat happens here is that `setState({})` in the capture phase non-React listener runs first. When re-rendering due to that first empty `setState({})`, input props still contain the old value (`\"\"`) while the DOM node's value is new (`\"a\"`). They're not equal, so we'll set the DOM node value to `\"\"` (according to the props) and remember `\"\"` as the current value.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"549\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-17 at 1 08 42 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/44241204-4b0e0880-a1ba-11e8-847d-bf9ca43eb954.png\">\r\n\r\nThen, `ChangeEventPlugin` tries to decide whether to emit a change event. It asks the tracker whether the value has changed. The tracker compares the presumably \"new\" `node.value` (it's `\"\"` — we've just set it earlier!) with the `lastValue` it has stored (also `\"\"` — and also just updated). No changes!\r\n\r\n<img width=\"505\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-17 at 1 10 59 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/810438/44241293-e0110180-a1ba-11e8-9c5a-b0d808f745cd.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nOur `\"a\"` update is lost. We never get the change event, and never actually get a chance to set the correct state."

            "body": "I wanted to create a list of things whose existence makes React bigger and more complicated than necessary. This makes them more likely to need to be deprecated and actually removed in a future version. No clue of when this will happen and what the recommended upgrade path will be so don't take this issue as advice that you should move away from them until there's clear upgrade advice. You might make it worse by doing so.\r\n\r\n(This has some overlap with https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/9475 but those seem more longer term.)\r\n\r\n- [ ] __Unsafe Life Cycles without UNSAFE prefix__ - We'll keep the ones prefixed UNSAFE indefinitely but the original ones will likely be deprecated and removed.\r\n\r\n- [ ] __Legacy context__ - `.contextTypes`, `.childContextTypes`, `getChildContext` - The old context is full of edge cases for when it is accidentally supposed to work and the way it is designed requires all React code to become slower just to support this feature.\r\n\r\n- [ ] __String refs__ - This requires current owner to be exposed at runtime. While it is likely that some form of owner will remain, this particular semantics is likely not what we want out of it. So rather than having two owners, we should just remove this feature. It also requires an extra field on every ReactElement which is otherwise not needed.\r\n\r\n- [ ] __Module pattern components__ - This is a little used feature that lets you return a class instance from a regular function without extending `React.Component`. This is not that useful. In practice the ecosystem has moved around ES class like usage, and other language compiling to JS tries to comply with that model as well. The existence of this feature means that we don't know that something is a functional component by just testing if it's a function that is not extending `React.Component`. Instead we have to do some extra feature testing for every functional component there is. It also prevents us from passing the ref as the second argument by default for all functional components without using `forwardRef` since that wouldn't be valid for class components.\r\n\r\n- [ ] __Uncontrolled onInput__ - This is described in #9657. Because we support uncontrolled polyfilling of this event, we have to do pretty invasive operations to the DOM like attaching setters. This is all in support of imperative usage of the DOM which should be out-of-scope for React.\r\n\r\n- [ ] __setState in componentDidCatch__ - Currently we support error recovery in `componentDidCatch` but once we support `getDerivedStateFromCatch` we might want to consider deprecating the old mechanism which automatically first commits null. The semantics of this are a bit weird and requires complicated code that we likely get wrong sometimes.\r\n\r\n- [ ] __Context Object As Consumer__ - Right now it is possible to use the Context object as a Consumer render prop. That's an artifact of reusing the same object allocation but not documented. We'll want to deprecate that and make it the Provider instead.\r\n\r\n- [ ] __No GC of not unmounted roots__ - This likely won't come with a warning. We'll just do it. It's not a breaking behavior other than memory usage. You have to call `unmountComponentAtNode` or that component won't be cleaned up. Almost always it is not cleaned up anyway since if you have at least one subscription that still holds onto it. Arguably this is not even a breaking change. #13293\r\n\r\n- [ ] __unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer__ - This is replaced by Portals. It is already problematic since it can't be used in life-cycles but it also add lots of special case code to transfer the context. Since legacy context itself likely will be deprecated, this serves no purposes.\r\n\r\n- [x] __ReactDOM.render with hydration__ - This has already been deprecated. This requires extra code and requires us to generate an extra attribute in the HTML to auto-select hydration. People should be using ReactDOM.hydrate instead. We just need to remove the old behavior and the attribute in ReactDOMServer.\r\n\r\n- [ ] __Return value of `ReactDOM.render()`__ - We can't synchronously return an instance when inside a lifecycle/callback/effect, or in concurrent mode. Should use a ref instead.\r\n\r\n- [ ] __All of `ReactDOM.render()`__ - Switch everyone over to `createRoot`, with an option to make `createRoot` sync."

However, in [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-microsyntaxes.html#boolean-attribute), the empty string is a truthy value in this context; it's one of the values that the standard specifically allows in boolean attributes.\r\n\r\nThe above is a potential source of confusion in itself, but React 16's handling of unknown attributes gives rise to the following hypothetical scenario: a new DOM boolean attribute `foobar` is introduced, some people write JSX code that uses it as `foobar=\"\"` (passed through to HTML, truthy), and later React adds `foobar` to its internal whitelist in a minor/patch version and starts processing it as a boolean (JS falsy, omitted from HTML); this would _technically_ be a breaking change for those people.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem.**\r\n\r\nhttps://codesandbox.io/s/y0pmz9149x\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nThere is definitely a clash of expectations here at the interface of JS and HTML.\r\n\r\n1. Coming from JS, `\"\"` is falsy and treating it as such in a \"boolean\" prop is fine; from this perspective, the current behaviour is justifiable.\r\n2. Coming from HTML, it might not be obvious that React is doing this \"extra\" processing and deviating from what's clearly stated in the HTML spec; from this perspective, the current behaviour is surprising.\r\n\r\nThere probably isn't justification for changing React's actual handling of `\"\"` (not least for fear of breaking code that relies on this long-standing behaviour, see version information below), but perhaps a warning about the ambiguity is warranted, a la #13372?\r\n\r\nNote that a warning won't fully mitigate the worst-case scenario I mentioned above (since we can't warn about a prop that we don't _know_ is a DOM boolean), but at least it would give some signal _after_ the React version update that the code might not be doing the expected thing anymore.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nVersions of React as far back as 0.14 (and probably way older) process whitelisted boolean DOM props the same way."

            "body": "Currently `createPortal` only works within the current renderer.\r\n\r\nThis means that if you want to embed one renderer into another (e.g. `react-art` in `react-dom`), your only option is to do an imperative render in a commit-time hook like `componentDidMount` or `componentDidUpdate` of the outer renderer's component. In fact that's exactly how `react-art` works today.\r\n\r\nWith this approach, nested renderers like `react-art` can't read the context of the outer renderers (https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12796). Similarly, we can't time-slice updates in inner renderers because we only update the inner container at the host renderer's commit time.\r\n\r\nAt the time we originally discussed portals we wanted to make them work across renderers. So that you could do something like\r\n\r\n```js\r\n<div>\r\n  <Portal to={ReactART}>\r\n    <surface>\r\n      <rect />\r\n    </surface>\r\n  </Portal>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it's not super clear how this should work because renderers can bundle incompatible Fiber implementations. Whose implementation takes charge?\r\n\r\nWe'll want to figure something out eventually. For now I'm filing this for future reference."

Obviously server side rendering is impossible via JSFiddle, but the markup should be equivalent to having rendered `Test` into a div with id `test-1` during server side render.\r\n\r\nhttps://jsfiddle.net/y8o5n2zg/\r\n\r\nAs seen in the fiddle, an attempt to ReactDOM.hydrate() a portal results in:\r\n> `Warning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching text node for \"Hello World\" in <div>.`\r\n\r\nAdditionally, after failing to hydrate, React renders the component and appends it resulting in a duplicated section of DOM:\r\n> `<div id=\"test-1\">Hello WorldHello World</div>`\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nIn an ideal world, calling hydrate on a component that has portals would allow those DOM containers to hydrate into the components they were rendered with.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI've only tested this in 16.4.1, but I've confirmed the behavior in Chrome and Firefox. Given that I'm really looking at an edge case here I doubt it worked previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### *Why* I'm doing this edge-case-y nonsense:\r\n\r\nWe're currently using multiple React roots on our pages (as some portions of the pages are not rendered by React yet), most of which are server-side rendered. We'd like to be able to hydrate them into a single React root on page, so that we can share contexts between them without difficulty and without repeating those context components in memory (in some cases we can have a good number of roots on the page—20-30, perhaps?).\r\n\r\nIn searching, I found a few potentially related bugs (#12615, #10713, #11169), but it seemed like these really didn't line up with my (hopefully valid?) use case.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

So far, it was possible to hack around the missing support for it by relying on unstable API (`unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer`) to render **and update** a subtree inside a different container. It's important to note that this API was using React's diffing algorithm so that, similar to `ReactDOM.render()`, it is possible to keep components mounted.\r\n\r\n```js\r\nReactDOM.render(<Foo />, container);\r\n// This won't get <Foo /> to be unmounted and mounted again:\r\nReactDOM.render(<Foo />, container);\r\n\r\nReactDOM.unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer(\r\n  parentComponent,\r\n  <Foo />,\r\n  container\r\n);\r\n// This also won't get <Foo /> to be unmounted and mounted again, no matter if \r\n// we change parentComponent (and thus call it from a different parent):\r\nReactDOM.unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer(\r\n  parentComponent,\r\n  <Foo />,\r\n  container\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever this unstable API is [going to be deprecated soon](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10143) and recent features like the introduction of the new context API introduced [additional issues](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12493).\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to this unstable API, `ReactDOM.createPortal(children, container)` was introduced. However this API is unsuitable for the reparenting issue since it will always [create a new mount point](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10713) inside the `container` instead of applying the diffing _when called from a different parent_ (Check out this [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/91o7oovo54) where calling the portal from a different portal will cause the `<Leaf />` to have a new uuid). The reason for this is that we want multiple portals to be able to render inside the same `container` which makes perfect sense for more common use cases like popovers, etc.\r\n\r\nBefore we're going to remove `unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer`, I suggest we find a way to portal into a specific node instead of appending to it so that we can diff its contents instead (or implement a solution for #3965 although that seems to be more complicated), similar to `unstable_renderSubtreeIntoContainer`."

Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\n* [Load the code above in the codepen REPL](https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/202/)\r\n* After the REPL loads, click the \"Run\" button at the top left.\r\n* You should see a blue \"link\" in the bottom-right pane.\r\n* Click it.  An alert will popup.\r\n\r\nThe alert should not pop up.\r\n\r\nA simple string that reaches an `href` attribute should not cause arbitrary code execution even with user interaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nA string that reaches a browser builtin like the `HTMLAElement.prototype.href` setter should not cause code execution.\r\n\r\n**Discussion**\r\n\r\n[Polymer Resin](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hepAXMroHSNTM0NV1aGlntjHrw0a0QOM5X5JvfXv_N0/edit#slide=id.g227691820f_0_198) uses hooks in another webcomponents framework to intercept value before they reach browser builtins where they can be vetted.  A similar approach could work for React.\r\n\r\nIt allows values to reach browser builtins when they are innocuous or have a runtime type that indicates that the author intentionally marked them as safe for that kind of browser builtin.\r\n\r\nFor example, an `instanceof SafeURL` would be allowed to reach `HTMLAElement.prototype.href` as would any string that is a relative URL, or one with a whitelisted protocol in (`http`, `https`, `mailto`, `tel`) but not `javascript:...`.\r\n\r\nMany developers know that `<a href={...}>` is risky, but if the link is an implementation detail of a custom React element, then developers don't have the context to know which attributes they need to be careful with.  They shouldn't have to either since it is an implementation detail.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nI believe this is widespread across versions.\r\n\r\nAn earlier REPL I tried showed that it worked on version 16.2.0 from https://unpkg.com/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js but I don't know what version the jsfiddle above uses.\r\n"

Step only seems to get honored if the initial value is \"\" or null.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nhttps://codepen.io/anon/pen/MQMBmX\r\n\r\nThe example uses a controlled input binding value and step. Step is 1/10th of the value. If you edit the value in the textbox to 50000 and increment using the stepper, it will increment to 50100 (i.e. by the initial value and not by the current step).\r\n\r\nEdit the code so initial value is \"\" or null. Edit textbox to 50000 and step up - value goes to 55000 as expected.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\nIt should be possible to render a number input that honors step without having to initialize the input component value to null or \"\" first.\r\n\r\nIt seems when there is an initial value provided, it will write a value attribute into the DOM (e.g. value=\"100\").  When initial value is \"\" or null then just the value attribute is written to DOM with no assignment. e.g. (value).\r\n\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n16.3.0-alpha.1  (ported to this version to confirm if still an issue)\r\n0.14.7 (originally found in this version)\r\n\r\nSeems to affect Chrome only (confirmed windows and mac, versions 59 and 64).

This used to work before React 16, and [seems related to this issue about nested ReactDOM renders](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12034)\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem. Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't have dependencies other than React. Paste the link to your JSFiddle (https://jsfiddle.net/Luktwrdm/) or CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new) example below:**\r\n\r\nHere's a [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/e5hbzc1r/14/) that documents the problem, with a simulation of the external dependency where this manifests.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI'm running into what I think is a [similar problem to this one](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/12034), with a nested `ReactDOM.render`, except where the difference is that I don't think we can use portals to address our use-case.\r\n\r\nWe have a component which manages the DOM tree for all nodes below it outside of React — it's a contenteditable node and uses the best-in-class [ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/) library to manage its children. The component looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nclass ProseMirror extends Component {\r\n\tcomponentDidMount() {\r\n\t\t// ProseMirror manages the DOM for all nodes below this.el.\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tsetRef(el) {\r\n\t\tthis.el = el;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\trender() {\r\n\t\treturn (<div ref={this.setRef} />);\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs part of its render cycle, our configuration of ProseMirror ends up calling:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nReactDOM.render(<CrucialSubComponent />, someDivManagedByProseMirror);\r\n```\r\n\r\nto render an isolated child node of `<ProseMirror />`, and wants to be able to immediately afterwards be able to leverage:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nthis.el.querySelector('.my-subcomponent')\r\n```\r\n\r\n...but this piece of the DOM is no longer available synchronously, and it looks like this is because of the re-entrancy change that came about in React 16. Portals don't work for us, because the site where the `ReactDOM.render` is being called isn't itself directly part of the root React tree (this is [clearer to observe in the fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/e5hbzc1r/14/)). The hierarchy is something like `<ProseMirror /> ---> (opaque ProseMirror rendering code) --> <CrucialSubComponent />`. Is there a way to skip these re-entrancy checks in these cases where there's an isolated React render happening in a grandchild of a component, but where the React tree isn't the immediate parent?\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nQuerying the DOM immediately after ReactDOM.render worked in versions prior to React 16. We're excited about the async possibilities for our main React tree, but curious if there are workarounds where we can ignore the reentrancy checks for these isolated renders."

The objects get stringified and added as attributes for smooth migration path because a lot of the existing code already depends on this behavior.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one pitfall here. Sometimes you made do `<div {...rest}>` and not realize that `rest` includes an object whose stringifying is unusually expensive. For example a deeply nested Immutable Map. Now, this wouldn't produce an error, but it would slow down rendering for no good reason.\r\n\r\nWe could protect against this by putting `performance.now()` counters around the places where we stringify attributes. If stringification takes more than, say, 2 milliseconds, then something bad is going on, and we should probably warn."

In this one the ./scripts/circleci/upload_build.sh step failed but you need to scroll through the output a significant amount to see that. This is in part because we have a custom entry point for all our CI steps ([scripts/circleci/test_entry_point.sh](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/v16.2.0/scripts/circleci/test_entry_point.sh)) to make it easier for us to parallelize some build steps.\r\n\r\nI'd like us to change that test_entry_point.sh script to output JUnit XML metadata for CircleCI as described in https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/collect-test-data/. Then I believe the CircleCI build results page will show exactly which step failed.\r\n\r\n(Bonus: If we can show individual Jest tests that would be even cooler. But I think the most important part is breaking out jest vs flow vs prettier, etc. into separate chunks.)"

Syncing the `value` attribute has been a consistent source of bugs for us, and the benefits of doing so seem minimal. There's some previous discussion on the topic in https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/7359 and in other issues, I can't remember right now 😄 \r\n\r\nThis would be a breaking change, so it would have to be done in a major release. \r\n\r\n## Reasons to keep syncing\r\n\r\n* It prevents `form.reset()` from putting controlled form inputs into a weird state\r\n* Some browser extensions (not sure which) read from the `value` attribute in some cases (not sure which)\r\n* It can be useful for querying inputs with a specific value using an attribute selector\r\n\r\n## Reasons to stop syncing\r\n\r\n* It will reduce the complexity of `react-dom` in a non-trivial way\r\n* In turn, it will likely reduce bundle size as well\r\n* We remove a whole class of bugs (fighting with browsers that want to be helpful about input values)\r\n* Syncing the input value to the attribute potentially exposes sensitive data to third party tools ([1](https://www.reddit.com/r/analytics/comments/7ukw4n/mixpanel_js_library_has_been_harvesting_passwords/))\r\n\r\n______\r\n\r\nWhat do we think?

Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nReact 16.2.0 and Chrome 63 on macOS 10.12.6.\r\n\r\nTested in Safari 11.0.2 and typing a period kinda works. After typing the first number after the period it gets converted to a comma but the cursor jumps to the beginning.\r\n\r\nAlso tested in Firefox 57.0.1 but it seems to think that period is the correct decimal mark."

Enter in some decimal value (e.g., `88.88`) into the input.\r\n4. Slowly backspace in the input.

This causes the focused input to be reset to the `defaultValue`, which won't be in sync with the tracked value because we do that work on blur for number inputs to avoid triggering validation warnings. This doesn't affect other input types, since the tracked value is updated immediately.\r\n\r\nThis might be a viable tradeoff for avoiding those validation warnings, so I'm not sure if this is actionable, but I wanted to at least document it for future reference.\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @nhunzaker @gaearon \r\n\r\n"

If we just let it call `setAttribute`, the browser would throw on a bad attribute name.\r\n\r\nThis check used to run very infrequently (only for data attributes and custom elements), but now more attributes follow this code path (since any \"simple\" attributes with the same names are effectively treated as unknown attributes). So even though we cache the result, it seems unfortunate to do the work that the browser is already doing for us.\r\n\r\nWhile this would be a breaking change (so it has to go in 17), I think we should just remove this check, and let the browser throw. This does make spreading props blindly a bit more dangerous, but we have a warning so it should be visible."

If the display value of the input is rendered in another component, it raises an exception because IE9 does not allow changes to `nodeValue` on unmounted text nodes.\r\n\r\nI think that's the issue, anyway. It is documented here:\r\n\r\nhttps://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedbackdetail/view/944330/invalid-argument-error-when-changing-nodevalue-of-a-text-node-removed-by-setting-innerhtml-on-an-ancestor\r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\n1. Open http://react-dom-test-fixtures.surge.sh/number-inputs in IE9\r\n2. Change the text in the first controlled text input\r\n3. Start debugging in the IE9 developer tools\r\n4. Press ctrl+z to undo your text change\r\n5. IE9 raises an exception when setting the nodeValue of the text label to the right of the input \"invalid arguments\":\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThis affects IE9 when using React 16. It is also an issue on master.\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nThe issue springs up in ReactDOM.js:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/blob/master/packages/react-dom/src/client/ReactDOM.js#L392-L398\r\n\r\nI think there just needs to be a wrapper around the text node to see if it has a parent before updating. Maybe something like:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\ncommitTextUpdate(\r\n  textInstance: TextInstance,\r\n  oldText: string,\r\n  newText: string,\r\n): void {\r\n  // IE9 will raise an exception if modifying a detached text node\r\n  // https://connect.microsoft.com/IE/feedbackdetail/view/944330/invalid-argument-error-when-changing-nodevalue-of-a-text-node-removed-by-setting-innerhtml-on-an-ancestor\r\n  if (textInstance.parentNode) {\r\n    textInstance.nodeValue = newText;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that feels like a band-aid solution. I'm curious what is causing the text node to unmount to begin-with."

            "body": "*Resuming* is the ability to re-use fibers after they are interrupted by a higher-priority update. Take the following scenario: A component is updated at a normal, async priority. Before the update is finished processing, a higher-priority update is scheduled (let's say it's synchronous, though it could also be a higher-priority async update). The sync update *interrupts* the async update, leaving it unfinished. After the sync update finishes, we go back to processing the interrupted, async update. It's possible, and even likely, that the interrupted work wasn't touched by the sync work and can be *resumed* without starting over completely.\r\n\r\nThis is an important optimization for several async features we have in mind, including error handling, blockers, pre-rendering, and hidden priority.\r\n\r\nWe used to have an implementation of resuming that mostly worked but had some bugs. A few months ago, I spent some time [identifying the bugs using fuzz testing](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9952) and fixing them by iterating on the existing algorithm. I eventually got a [version working that passed all the tests](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/9695). But even this version didn't have all of the features we wanted, and the algorithm seemed inherently flawed. So we decided it would be best to scrap the existing algorithm and revisit resuming in the future.\r\n\r\nWe now believe we have a better idea of how resuming should work. I'm going to split the work into multiple PRs, and use this issue to keep track of our progress.\r\n\r\nMy apologies if some of my descriptions are hard to follow. It can be difficult to describe without resorting to jargon. I'll iterate on this issue as I work.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlways reconcile against current child set (#11564)\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is a small refactor that reflects what we already do without resuming: the set we reconcile against is always the current set. In the reverted resuming algorithm, the set we reconcile against was sometimes a work-in-progress set, and there are a few code paths that are left over from that implementation.\r\n\r\nStash interrupted children\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen cloning a work-in-progress fiber from current, and there is already an existing work-in-progress that was interrupted, stash the interrupted work-in-progress children (and corresponding fields) in case we can reuse them later. In begin phase, add an additional check to see if incoming props/state match the interrupted props/state. If so, bail out and re-use the interrupted children. If not, the interrupted children are no longer useful, because we're about to re-render the parent and overwrite them. (Unmounted fibers actually can be re-used even if we re-render the parent; see next step.)\r\n\r\nThis gets us back to the same functionality we had in the old resuming algorithm. We can now resume interrupted children if we come back to it at the same priority at which it was originally rendered. The main limitation is that the work is lost if the parent is re-rendered at a higher priority.\r\n\r\n**Need a way to distinguish between a work-in-progress fiber and the \"previous current\" fiber*\r\n\r\nPool unmounted, interrupted children so they can resume even if parent re-renders at higher priority\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen a fiber is about to be re-rendered, and there are interrupted children that could not be reused, search through the interrupted children and find the ones that are unmounted (don't have an alternate). Stash the unmounted children in a separate set; they can be kept around indefinitely without being overwritten. This set acts like a pool of children. The next time the parent is re-rendered at the priority of the interrupted children, check the pool for matches before creating new fibers.\r\n\r\n"

For example, does `react` have a bunch of named exports, but also a default export called `React`? Should we encourage people to `import *` for better tree shaking? What about `react-test-renderer/shallow` that currently exports a class (and thus would start failing in Node were it converted to be a default export)?"

However, this is often a valid condition. For example, when creating a new object (initialized w/ default values from the server then passed to the component as props) in a form that requires address, Address Line 2 is often optional. As such, passing null as value to this controlled component is a very reasonable thing to do.\r\n\r\nOne can do a workaround, i.e. `<input value={foo || ''} onChange={this.handleChange} />`, but this is an error-prone approach and quite awkward.\r\n\r\nPer issue referenced above, the React team has planned on treating null as an empty string, but that hasn't yet occurred. I'd like to propose tackling this problem in the near future.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if I can help further."

In that scenario, we end up with something like:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<x-foo bar=\"[object Object]\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe workaround for this is to use a `ref` to manually set the property.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<x-foo ref={el => el.bar = baz}>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis workaround feels a bit unnecessary as the majority of custom elements being shipped today are written with libraries which automatically generate JavaScript properties that back all of their exposed attributes. And anyone hand-authoring a vanilla custom element is [encouraged to follow this practice](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/best-practices#attributes-properties) as well. We'd like to ideally see runtime communication with custom elements in React use JavaScript properties by default.\r\n\r\nThis doc outlines a few proposals for how React could be updated to make this happen.\r\n\r\n# Proposals\r\n\r\n## Option 1: Only set properties\r\n\r\nRather than try to decide if a property or attribute should be set, React could *always* set properties on custom elements. React would **NOT** check to see if the property exists on the element beforehand.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<x-foo bar={baz}>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code would result in React setting the `.bar` property of the `x-foo` element equal to the value of `baz`.\r\n\r\nFor camelCased property names, React could use the same style it uses today for properties like `tabIndex`.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<x-foo squidInk={pasta}> // sets .squidInk = pasta\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n#### Easy to understand/implement\r\n\r\nThis model is simple, explicit, and dovetails with React’s [\"JavaScript-centric API to the DOM\"](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/09/08/dom-attributes-in-react-16.html#why-are-we-changing-this).\r\n\r\nAny element created with libraries like Polymer or Skate will automatically generate properties to back their exposed attributes. These elements should all \"just work\" with the above approach. Developers hand-authoring vanilla components are encouraged to [back attributes with properties](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/best-practices#always-accept-primitive-data-strings-numbers-booleans-as-either-attributes--or-properties) as that mirrors how *modern* (i.e. not oddballs like `<input>`) HTML5 elements (`<video>`, `<audio>`, etc.) have been implemented.\r\n\r\n#### Avoids conflict with future global attributes\r\n\r\nWhen React sets an attribute on a custom element there’s always the risk that a future version of HTML will ship a similarly named attribute and break things. This concern was [discussed with spec authors](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/654) but there is no clear solution to the problem. Avoiding attributes entirely (except when a developer explicitly sets one using `ref`) may sidestep this issue until the browsers come up with a better solution.\r\n\r\n#### Takes advantage of custom element \"upgrade\"\r\n\r\nCustom elements can be lazily [upgraded](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements#upgrades) on the page and some PRPL patterns rely on this technique. During the upgrade process, a custom element can access the properties passed to it by React—even if those properties were set before the definition loaded—and use them to render initial state.\r\n\r\n#### Custom elements treated like any other React component\r\n\r\nWhen React components pass data to one another they already use properties. This would just make custom elements behave the same way.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n#### Possibly a breaking change\r\n\r\nIf a developer has been hand-authoring vanilla custom elements which only have an attributes API, then they will need to update their code or their app will break. The fix would be to use a `ref` to set the attribute (explained below).\r\n\r\n#### Need ref to set attribute\r\n\r\nBy changing the behavior so properties are preferred, it means developers will need to use a `ref` in order to explicitly set an attribute on a custom element.\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<custom-element ref={el => el.setAttribute('my-attr', val)} />\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is just a reversal of the current behavior where developers need a `ref` in order to set a property. Since developers should rarely need to set attributes on custom elements, this seems like a reasonable trade-off.\r\n\r\n#### Not clear how server-side rendering would work\r\n\r\nIt's not clear how this model would map to server-side rendering custom elements. React could assume that the properties map to similarly named attributes and attempt to set those on the server, but this is far from bulletproof and would possibly require a heuristic for things like camelCased properties -> dash-cased attributes.\r\n\r\n## Option 2: Properties-if-available\r\n\r\nAt runtime React could attempt to detect if a property is present on a custom element. If the property is present React will use it, otherwise it will fallback to setting an attribute. This is the model Preact uses to deal with custom elements.\r\n\r\n**Pseudocode implementation:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nif (propName in element) {\r\n  element[propName] = value;\r\n} else {\r\n  element.setAttribute(propName.toLowerCase(), value);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Possible steps:**\r\n\r\n* If an element has a defined property, React will use it.\r\n\r\n* If an element has an undefined property, and React is trying to pass it primitive data (string/number/boolean), it will use an attribute.\r\n\r\n    * Alternative: Warn and don’t set.\r\n\r\n* If an element has an undefined property, and React is trying to pass it an object/array it will set it as a property. This is because some-attr=\"[object Object]” is not useful.\r\n\r\n    * Alternative: Warn and don’t set.\r\n\r\n* If the element is being rendered on the server, and React is trying to pass it a string/number/boolean, it will use an attribute.\r\n\r\n* If the element is being rendered on the server, and React is trying to pass it a object/array, it will not do anything.\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n#### Non-breaking change\r\n\r\nIt is possible to create a custom element that only uses attributes as its interface. This authoring style is **NOT** encouraged, but it may happen regardless. If a custom element author is relying on this behavior then this change would be non-breaking for them.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n#### Developers need to understand the heuristic\r\n\r\nDevelopers might be confused when React sets an attribute instead of a property depending on how they’ve chosen to load their element.\r\n\r\n#### Falling back to attributes may conflict with future globals\r\n\r\nSebastian [raised a concern](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10399#issuecomment-320847065) that using `in` to check for the existence of a property on a custom element might accidentally detect a property on the superclass (HTMLElement).\r\n\r\nThere are also other potential conflicts with global attributes [discussed previously](#avoids-conflict-with-future-global-attributes) in this doc.\r\n\r\n## Option 3: Differentiate properties with a sigil\r\n\r\nReact could continue setting attributes on custom elements, but provide a sigil that developers could use to explicitly set properties instead. This is similar to [the approach used by Glimmer.js](https://www.emberjs.com/blog/2017/10/10/glimmer-progress-report.html#toc_component-attributes).\r\n\r\n**Glimmer example:**\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<custom-img @src=\"corgi.jpg\" @hiResSrc=\"corgi@2x.jpg\" width=\"100%\">\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the above example, the @ sigil indicates that `src` and `hiResSrc` should pass data to the custom element using properties, and `width` should be serialized to an attribute string.\r\n\r\nBecause React components already pass data to one another using properties, there would be no need for them to use the sigil (although it would work if they did, it would just be redundant). Instead, it would primarily be used as an explicit instruction to pass data to a custom element using JavaScript properties.\r\n\r\n*h/t to @developit of Preact for suggesting this approach :)*\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n#### Non-breaking change that developers can opt-in to\r\n\r\nAll pre-existing React + custom element apps would continue to work exactly as they have. Developers could choose if they wanted to update their code to use the new sigil style.\r\n\r\n#### Similar to how other libraries handle attributes/properties\r\n\r\nSimilar to Glimmer, both Angular and Vue use modifiers to differentiate between attributes and properties.\r\n\r\n**Vue example:**\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Vue will serialize `foo` to an attribute string, and set `squid` using a JavaScript property -->\r\n<custom-element :foo=\"bar” :squid.prop=”ink”>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Angular example:**\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!-- Angular will serialize `foo` to an attribute string, and set `squid` using a JavaScript property -->\r\n<custom-element [attr.foo]=\"bar” [squid]=”ink”>\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### The system is explicit\r\n\r\nDevelopers can tell React exactly what they want instead of relying on a heuristic like the [properties-if-available](#option-2--properties-if-available) approach.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n#### It’s new syntax\r\n\r\nDevelopers need to be taught how to use it and it needs to be thoroughly tested to make sure it is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n#### Not clear how server-side rendering would work\r\n\r\nShould the sigil switch to using a similarly named attribute?\r\n\r\n## Option 4: Add an attributes object\r\n\r\nReact could add additional syntax which lets authors explicitly pass data as attributes. If developers do not use this attributes object, then their data will be passed using JavaScript properties.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\nconst bar = 'baz';\r\nconst hello = 'World';\r\nconst width = '100%';\r\nconst ReactElement = <Test\r\n  foo={bar} // uses JavaScript property\r\n  attrs={{ hello, width }} // serialized to attributes\r\n/>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis idea was [originally proposed](https://gist.github.com/treshugart/2fb509a8828adf7fee5245bfa2a54ba7) by @treshugart, author of Skate.js, and is implemented in the [val](https://github.com/skatejs/val) library.\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n#### The system is explicit\r\n\r\nDevelopers can tell React exactly what they want instead of relying on a heuristic like the [properties-if-available](#option-2--properties-if-available) approach.\r\n\r\n#### Extending syntax may also solve issues with event handling\r\n\r\n*Note: This is outside the scope of this document but maybe worth mentioning :)*\r\n\r\nIssue [#7901](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/7901) requests that React bypass its synthetic event system when declarative event handlers are added to custom elements. Because custom element event names are arbitrary strings, it means they can be capitalized in any fashion. To bypass the synthetic event system today will also mean needing to come up with a heuristic for mapping event names from JSX to `addEventListener`.\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// should this listen for: 'foobar', 'FooBar', or 'fooBar'?\r\nonFooBar={handleFooBar}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if the syntax is extended to allow attributes it could also be extended to allow events as well:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst bar = 'baz';\r\nconst hello = 'World';\r\nconst SquidChanged = e => console.log('yo');\r\nconst ReactElement = <Test\r\n  foo={bar}\r\n  attrs={{ hello }}\r\n  events={{ SquidChanged}} // addEventListener('SquidChanged', …)\r\n/>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this model the variable name is used as the event name. No heuristic is needed.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n#### It’s new syntax\r\n\r\nDevelopers need to be taught how to use it and it needs to be thoroughly tested to make sure it is backwards compatible.\r\n\r\n#### It may be a breaking change\r\n\r\nIf any components already rely on properties named `attrs` or `events`, it could break them.\r\n\r\n#### It may be a larger change than any of the previous proposals\r\n\r\nFor React 17 it may be easier to make an incremental change (like one of the previous proposals) and position this proposal as something to take under consideration for a later, bigger refactor.\r\n\r\n## Option 5: An API for consuming custom elements\r\n\r\n*This proposal was offered by @sophiebits and @gaearon from the React team*\r\n\r\nReact could create a new API for consuming custom elements that maps the element’s behavior with a configuration object.\r\n\r\n**Pseudocode example:**\r\n\r\n```js\r\nconst XFoo = ReactDOM.createCustomElementType({\r\n  element: ‘x-foo’,\r\n  ‘my-attr’: // something that tells React what to do with it\r\n  someRichDataProp: // something that tells React what to do with it\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above code returns a proxy component, `XFoo` that knows how to pass data to a custom element depending on the configuration you provide. You would use this proxy component in your app instead of using the custom element directly.\r\n\r\n**Example usage:**\r\n\r\n```jsx\r\n<XFoo someRichDataProp={...} />\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\n#### The system is explicit\r\n\r\nDevelopers can tell React the exact behavior they want.\r\n\r\n#### Non-breaking change\r\n\r\nDevelopers can opt-in to using the object or continue using the current system.\r\n\r\n#### Idiomatic to React\r\n\r\nThis change doesn’t require new JSX syntax, and feels more like other APIs in React. For example, PropTypes (even though it’s being moved into its own package) has a somewhat similar approach.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\n#### Could be a lot of work for a complex component\r\n\r\nPolymer’s [paper-input](https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/paper-input/elements/paper-input) element has 37 properties, so it would produce a very large config. If developers are using a lot of custom elements in their app, that may equal a lot of configs they need to write.\r\n\r\n#### May bloat bundle size\r\n\r\nRelated to the above point, each custom element class now incurs the cost of its definition + its config object size.\r\n\r\n*Note: I'm not 100% sure if this is true. Someone more familiar with the React build process could verify.*\r\n\r\n#### Config needs to keep pace with the component\r\n\r\nEvery time the component does a minor version revision that adds a new property, the config will need to be updated as well. That’s not difficult, but it does add maintenance. Maybe if configs are generated from source this is less of a burden, but that may mean needing to create a new tool to generate configs for each web component library.\r\n\r\n\r\ncc @sebmarkbage @gaearon @developit @treshugart @justinfagnani"

And when it does, it includes other [spec'd properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/InputEvent) which can be extremely helpful:\r\n\r\n- `inputType` tells you whether the event is inserting text, replacing text, inserting a line break, etc.\r\n- `getTargetRanges()` tells you where the input is taking place in the DOM.\r\n\r\nRight now this information isn't exposed, because even if the browser supports `beforeinput`, it's not being checked for.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nInstead React should treat `textInput` as a slightly-preferred fallback for native `beforeinput` support, but add `beforeinput` as the true goal. So we'd end up with a fallback stack of:\r\n\r\n- `beforeinput`\r\n- `textInput`\r\n- `keypress`\r\n\r\nWhich guarantees that the `nativeEvent` will always be the most spec'd and have the most relevant information associated with it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe `beforeinput` event's extra properties are critical in `contenteditable` situations, when you want to prevent the default browser behavior from firing but perform the logic on an internal model instead. (I'm looking to do this for [Slate](https://github.com/ianstormtaylor/slate).) \r\n\r\nWithout that extra information you have to fallback to hackier behavior—allowing the event to occur, trying to parse the DOM for what the change was, then re-rendering to remove it, etc. I want to avoid this on the more modern browsers, because it results in reduced performance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThere is another situation that this fixes, which is that spellcheck right now doesn't trigger React's `onBeforeInput` handler, even though modern browsers fire the `beforeinput` event, because it's not being listened for right now.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Also kinda just going with the flow where this seems to be the place to raise generic \"issues\" even if they're not bugs :)\r\n\r\n1. keys can make things slower\r\n\r\nI had a bunch of items, and the only thing that changed was their x/y positions. adding a key with index made rendering slower. It's possible this is short-sighted though since it could very well change once that \"layer\" has more items changing above/below it, but I found it interesting.\r\n\r\n2. rendering null makes a _huge_ difference\r\n\r\nI had two test cases - a full graphics pipeline vs. an essentially empty POJO renderer. The difference in speed didn't matter about the data or graphics, but rather about what was returned in the components `render()`. For DOM this doesn't work of course - but for custom renderers, when it's known that a certain type of element will be an edge node - doing the side effects in render() (or some other lifecycle) and then returning `null` is _significantly_ faster than even a straight functional component that returns a simple element (which does the same side effects). This makes sense, since react then has less branches to consider (even if those branches point to nothing other than simple objects).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Expected behaviour is for it to be fired only once per focus.\r\n\r\n2. Live demo: https://codesandbox.io/s/101pnjxq27\r\n\r\n3. Minimal steps to reproduce\r\n- install create-react-app\r\n`$ npm install -g create-react-app`\r\n\r\n- create an example application\r\n`$ create-react-app input-focus-test`\r\n`$ cd input-focus-test`\r\n\r\n- edit application file and add input with onFocus event handler\r\n`$ vi src/App.js`\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React, { Component } from 'react';\r\nimport logo from './logo.svg';\r\nimport './App.css';\r\n\r\nclass App extends Component {\r\n  handleOnFocus = evt => {\r\n        console.log('handleOnFocus', evt);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render() {\r\n    return (\r\n      <div className=\"App\">\r\n        <header className=\"App-header\">\r\n          <img src={logo} className=\"App-logo\" alt=\"logo\" />\r\n          <h1 className=\"App-title\">Welcome to React</h1>\r\n        </header>\r\n        <p className=\"App-intro\">\r\n          To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Input\r\n          <input onFocus={this.handleOnFocus}/>\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default App;\r\n```\r\n\r\n- start application\r\n`$ npm run start`\r\n\r\n- open up locahost:3000 in Safari\r\n- click on the input field with developer’s console opened\r\n- notice focus event fired multiple times\r\n\r\n4. Additional info\r\nThis issue has been found in the following environment:\r\n- macOS Sierra version 10.12.6 (also tested and found on High Sierra)\r\n- Safari 10.1.2 (also tested and found in Safari 10.0 and Safari 11, seems to work on latest Safari mobile, Chrome and Firefox)\r\n- React JS 15.5.4 (also tested and found in React 16)\r\n- example steps to reproduce above generated with create-react-app version 1.4.1\r\n\r\nSome of our observations that might come in handy:\r\n- this issue seems to behave randomly to some extent\r\n- event is usually fired twice when changing focus from input to input (so first click on input fires two events, consequential fire only one, but when changing focus to a different input field it fires twice again)\r\n- additional interesting behavior happens with multiple input fields; for instance with input fields 1 and 2, first focus on input 1 generates two events onFocus with input 1, but then focus on input 2 sometimes generates three events: onFocus with input 1, then input 2, then input 1 again as targets.\r\n"

One thing unfortunately where react is not as strong is in performance, which gave roots to Inferno and Preact. Although, this is generally a non-issue on desktop, while mobile might be a bottleneck.\r\n\r\nI know many members of the team have been working on improving bundle size (I believe through rollup support in a talk I heard), asynchronous scheduling, etc. I am also aware that @trueadm (the creator of inferno) joined the React team and is working on improving it.\r\n\r\nThe point I want to bring up is this library [petit-dom](https://github.com/yelouafi/petit-dom). It uses, is a diff algorithm (links that explain it provided in the README) and it seems to score incredibly on [vdom performance tests](https://github.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark). In fact, it is only beat by 2 technologies, vanillajs and surplusjs [per the benchmark snapshot](https://rawgit.com/krausest/js-framework-benchmark/master/webdriver-ts-results/table.html).\r\n\r\npetit-dom beats inferno, preact, mithril, vue, angular, etc. Of course, it is not a proper js framework, however the point I am trying to make is that it is far faster and a major difference between the other frameworks seems to be its diff algorithm.\r\n\r\nI realize this would mean a rewrite of a good portion of react-dom, which is why it is simply a discussion :D.\r\n\r\nIf this is unfeasible, or simply going after the wrong target/bottleneck, let me know as it is after all a discussion."

Then you click on a link and press the back button. The browser back-forward cache will kick in and change the initial value of the form elements. We will get our `foo` value back.\r\nHowever, React doesn't account for it when the component is controlled.\r\n\r\nI have tried reproducing the behavior with jsfiddle with [react@latest](https://jsfiddle.net/d4fovwxx/) and [react@next](https://jsfiddle.net/vm5vouqo/) with no luck as the BFcache doesn't kick in without SSR.\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nI expect React triggering a `onChange` event to replicate the actual form value.\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\n- React `@latest`.\r\n- Chrome `@latest`\r\n\r\nWe have been [using the following hack](https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/blob/v1-beta/src/Input/Input.js#L349-#L356) on Material-UI:\r\n```js\r\n  componentDidMount() {\r\n    // Fix SSR issue with the go back feature of the browsers.\r\n    // Let's say you start filling the input with \"foo\", you change the page then after comes back.\r\n    // The browser will reset the input value to \"foo\", but we also need to tell React about it.\r\n    this.handleChange({\r\n      target: this.input,\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it comes with issues: https://github.com/callemall/material-ui/pull/8110.\r\nSo instead, we tried simulating a change event [as suggested in StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23892547/what-is-the-best-way-to-trigger-onchange-event-in-react-js) but it doesn't work anymore\r\n```js\r\nvar event = new Event('input', { bubbles: true });\r\nelement.dispatchEvent(event);\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo for now, we are going to disable the BFcache with `<form autoComplete=\"off\">`."

This one is __much__ more uncommon than the one in #3473 though.\r\n\r\nYou should already have a pretty centralized way of sanitizing these objects so it seems to me that adding a Symbol to this object shouldn't be that big of a deal though.\r\n\r\nEither:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n{ $$typeof:Symbol.for('react.rawhtml'), __html: myHTML }\r\n```\r\nor:\r\n```js\r\n{ [Symbol.for('react.rawhtml')]: myHTML }\r\n```"

I already had a global window error handler which was working fine, but it unexpectedly catches errors that I would expect componentDidCatch to have handled. That is, component-local errors are being treated as window-global errors in dev builds.\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to stem from `invokeGuardedCallbackDev` in `ReactErrorUtils.js`. I think that this entire `__DEV__` block of code is problematic. The stated rational is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  // In DEV mode, we swap out invokeGuardedCallback for a special version\r\n  // that plays more nicely with the browser's DevTools. The idea is to preserve\r\n  // \"Pause on exceptions\" behavior. Because React wraps all user-provided\r\n  // functions in invokeGuardedCallback, and the production version of\r\n  // invokeGuardedCallback uses a try-catch, all user exceptions are treated\r\n  // like caught exceptions, and the DevTools won't pause unless the developer\r\n  // takes the extra step of enabling pause on caught exceptions. This is\r\n  // untintuitive, though, because even though React has caught the error, from\r\n  // the developer's perspective, the error is uncaught.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is misguided because it's not about pausing on exceptions, it's about \"pause on _uncaught_ exceptions.\" However, `componentDidCatch` makes exceptions _caught_!\r\n\r\nRather than switching on prod vs dev and using try/catch in prod and window's error handler in dev, React should always use try/catch, but rethrow if you reach the root without hitting a componentDidCatch handler. This would preserve the correct \"pause on uncaught exceptions\" behavior without messing with global error handlers."

But this can affect performance in some situations or even 'break the expectations' in others (e.g. animating moved elements [i.e. simple moves]) \r\n\r\n**What is the current behavior?**\r\n\r\nWhen a child element moves from the end of the list to the front  React actually moves all the other elements after the moved/last element instead of simply inserting the moved element at the front of the list.\r\n\r\nThis also can be stated more generally for an element or a block of elements moving backward with a significant shift.\r\n\r\n**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce and if possible a minimal demo of the problem via https://jsfiddle.net or similar (template: https://jsfiddle.net/84v837e9/).**\r\n\r\nHere is a [demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/wjZkrGVzJ) that shows the DOM operations performed on DOM nodes (moves & insertions) during reconciliation. To reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n- type '0123456789x' in the input field then click `Patch!`\r\n\r\n- now type 'x0123456789' (move the last 'x' to the front) then click `Patch!` again\r\n\r\nHere's the output\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5453835/28969007-affc2dae-791a-11e7-951a-37856bc53f00.png)\r\n\r\nInstead of moving the 'x' to the front. React actually moves all the other elements after the 'x'\r\n\r\n*Note: the demo uses MutationObserver api to find out the operations. But you can also verify this behavior directly by commenting out the code that activates the dom observer (in componentDidMount) and watch the dom operations manually in the devtools element inspector*\r\n\r\n**What is the expected behavior?**\r\n\r\nReact should perform the minimal number of operations. I know that the 'minimum' will vary for each situation and not trivial to infer for the general case. But for some common cases like this one it should be feasible.\r\n\r\nFor info this use case is handled in most of the other virtual dom libs like preact, snabbdom. Inferno is a remarkable case as it will always infer the minimum number of operations (it uses an algorithm to find the [longest increasing subsequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_increasing_subsequence) on an array containing the indexes of the old elements).\r\n\r\nI found this behavior while working on a demo to find out how vdom libs rearrange nodes during children reconciliation. For example here is the same output for other libs ([demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/BkLpXYQn))\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5453835/28969902-567219c0-791e-11e7-9f3d-29bf988cdab1.png)\r\n\r\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**\r\n\r\nThe demo uses the 0.16 version. But I tried with 0.15 and it has the same behavior"

Ideally it should instead queue up all the differences and then at the end (commit) issue a single warning with a nicely formatted diff.\r\n\r\n1) Instead of warning add [these warn calls](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/8d61138186e79e1e719786c8c76186e64b603bd5/src/renderers/dom/fiber/ReactDOMFiberComponent.js#L74-L115) to a global buffer (array, map, set, whatever).\r\n\r\n2) Inside [prepareForCommit](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/8d61138186e79e1e719786c8c76186e64b603bd5/src/renderers/dom/fiber/ReactDOMFiberEntry.js#L190), issue all the currently batched up warnings as a single message. \r\n\r\n3) Format that message in terms of a JSX diff in a nicely formatted way. With only the relevant nodes (parent and child with changes). Irrelevant child content can be replaced with ellipsis. E.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n...\r\n<div className=\"unchanged\">\r\n- <div className=\"foo\" />\r\n+ <div className=\"bar\">…</div>\r\n+ <span />\r\n</div>\r\n...\r\n<div className=\"another_unchanged\">\r\n- <span />\r\n</div>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis strategy won't yield perfect results because if we're asynchronously hydrating, and it gets interrupted by another tree, we'll flush a warning before the actual hydrating particular tree is flushed. So we might show a partial diff in that case. This is probably. It's just a warning."

I'd be happy to create the above package, for example, and I know the community would love a guarantee that enzyme would always work with any official React version release, prior to the release."

However, in an app that consumes this component library package, a dev may want to create a `<SpecialProductButton />` that in turn renders a `<Button>` - however, they're unable to pass it into `ButtonRow` (our propType warnings fail tests), even though conceptually it should be permitted.\r\n\r\nHaving `.renderTypes` would allow us to widen our `children` propType to allow for either a `<Button>`, or *anything that renders a `<Button>`*, which helps us maintain separation of concerns (the package doesn't have to know about `<SpecialProductButton>` to accept it) as well as maintain strictness (the package doesn't have to allow any wacky element inside `<ButtonRow>`).\r\n\r\nI imagine the implementation to be:\r\n 1. when render() is called or an SFC is invoked, (in async rendering, it'd be when the component resolves, i suppose)\r\n 1. in development only and if `.renderTypes` exists on the component\r\n 1. evaluate the equivalent of [`elementType`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/airbnb-prop-types)`(...Component.renderTypes)({ children: renderedValue }, 'children', ...)`,\r\n 1. just like propTypes, log the error if one is returned\r\n\r\n(cc @spicyj)"
